<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the beginning, before the heaven
and the earth and the sea were created, the great abyss Ginungagap was
without form and void, and the spirit of Fimbultyr moved upon the face
of the deep, until the ice-cold rivers, the Elivogs, flowing from
Niflheim, came in contact with the dazzling flames from Muspelheim. This
was before Chaos.</p>

<p>And Fimbultyr said: Let the melted drops of vapor quicken into life,
and the giant Ymer was born in the midst of Ginungagap. He was not a
god, but the father of all the race of evil giants. This was Chaos.</p>

<p>And Fimbultyr said: Let Ymer be slain and let order be established.
And straightway Odin and his brothers&mdash;the bright sons of
Bure&mdash;gave Ymer a mortal wound, and from his body made they the
universe; from his flesh, the earth; from his blood, the sea; from his
bones, the rocks; from his hair, the trees; from his skull, the vaulted
heavens; from his eye-brows, the bulwark called Midgard. And the gods
formed man and woman in their own image of two trees, and breathed into
them the breath of life. Ask and Embla became living souls, and they
received a garden in Midgard as a dwelling-place for themselves and
their children until the end of time. This was Cosmos.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8"> </a>
The world’s last day approaches. All bonds and fetters that bound the
forces of heaven and earth together are severed, and the powers of good
and of evil are brought together in an internecine feud. Loke advances
with the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard-serpent, his own children, with all
the hosts of the giants, and with Surt, who flings fire and flame over
the world. Odin advances with all the asas and all the blessed
einherjes. They meet, contend, and fall. The wolf swallows Odin, but
Vidar, the Silent, sets his foot upon the monster’s lower jaw, he seizes
the other with his hand, and thus rends him till he dies. Frey
encounters Surt, and terrible blows are given ere Frey falls. Heimdal
and Loke fight and kill each other, and so do Tyr and the dog Garm from
the Gnipa Cave. Asa-Thor fells the Midgard-serpent with his Mjolner, but
he retreats only nine paces when he himself falls dead, suffocated by
the serpent’s venom. Then smoke wreathes up around the ash Ygdrasil, the
high flames play against the heavens, the graves of the gods, of the
giants and of men are swallowed up by the sea, and the end has come.
This is Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods.</p>

<p>But the radiant dawn follows the night. The earth, completely green,
rises again from the sea, and where the mews have but just been rocking
on restless waves, rich fields unplowed and unsown, now wave their
golden harvests before the gentle breezes. The asas awake to a new life,
Balder is with them again. Then comes the mighty Fimbultyr, the god who
is from everlasting to
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9"> </a>
everlasting; the god whom the Edda skald dared not name. The god of gods
comes to the asas. He comes to the great judgment and gathers all the
good into Gimle to dwell there forever, and evermore delights enjoy; but
the perjurers and murderers and adulterers he sends to Nastrand, that
terrible hall, to be torn by Nidhug until they are purged from their
wickedness. This is Regeneration.</p>

<p>These are the outlines of the Teutonic religion. Such were the
doctrines established by Odin among our ancestors. Thus do we find it
recorded in the Eddas of Iceland.</p>

<p>The present volume contains all of the Younger Edda that can possibly
be of any importance to English readers. In fact, it gives more than has
ever before been presented in any translation into English, German or
any of the modern Scandinavian tongues.</p>

<p>We would recommend our readers to omit the Forewords and Afterwords
until they have perused the Fooling of Gylfe and Brage’s Speech. The
Forewords and Afterwords, it will readily be seen, are written by a
later and less skillful hand, and we should be sorry to have anyone lay
the book aside and lose the pleasure of reading Snorre’s and Olaf’s
charming work, because he became disgusted with what seemed to him mere
silly twaddle. And yet these Forewords and Afterwords become interesting
enough when taken up in connection with a study of the historical
anthropomorphized Odin. With a view of giving a pretty complete outline
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10"> </a>
of the founder of the Teutonic race we have in our notes given all the
Heimskringla sketch of the Black Sea Odin. We have done this, not only
on account of the material it furnishes as the groundwork of a Teutonic
epic, which we trust the muses will ere long direct some one to write,
but also on account of the vivid picture it gives of Teutonic life as
shaped and controlled by the Odinic faith.</p>

<p>All the poems quoted in the Younger Edda have in this edition been
traced back to their sources in the Elder Edda and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Where the notes seem to the reader insufficient, we must refer him to
our Norse Mythology, where he will, we trust, find much of the
additional information he may desire.</p>

<p>Well aware that our work has many imperfections, and begging our
readers to deal generously with our shortcomings, we send the book out
into the world with the hope that it may aid some young son or daughter
of Odin to find his way to the fountains of Urd and Mimer and to Idun’s
rejuvenating apples. The son must not squander, but husband wisely, what
his father has accumulated. The race must cherish and hold fast and add
to the thought that the past has bequeathed to it. Thus does it grow
greater and richer with each new generation. The past is the mirror that
reflects the future.</p>

<h3 class = "chapter">THE YOUNGER EDDA.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h4><a name = "intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> records of our Teutonic past
have hitherto received but slight attention from the English-speaking
branch of the great world-ash Ygdrasil. This indifference is the more
deplorable, since a knowledge of our heroic forefathers would naturally
operate as a most powerful means of keeping alive among us, and our
posterity, that spirit of courage, enterprise and independence for which
the old Teutons were so distinguished.</p>

<p>The religion of our ancestors forms an important chapter in the
history of the childhood of our race, and this fact has induced us to
offer the public an English translation of the Eddas. The purely
mythological portion of the Elder Edda was translated and published by
A.&nbsp;S. Cottle, in Bristol, in 1797, and the whole work was
translated by Benjamin Thorpe, and published in London in 1866. Both
these works are now out of print. Of the Younger Edda we have likewise
had two translations into English,&mdash;the first by Dasent in 1842,
the second by Blackwell, in his
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16"> </a>
edition of Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, in 1847. The former has long
been out of print, the latter is a poor imitation of Dasent’s. Both of
them are very incomplete. These four books constitute all the Edda
literature we have had in the English language, excepting, of course,
single lays and chapters translated by Gray, Henderson, W. Taylor,
Herbert, Jamieson, Pigott, William and Mary Howitt, and others.</p>

<p>The Younger Edda (also called Snorre’s Edda, or the Prose Edda), of
which we now have the pleasure of presenting our readers an English
version, contains, as usually published in the original, the following
divisions:</p>

<p>1. The Foreword.</p>

<p>2. Gylfaginning (The Fooling of Gylfe).</p>

<p>3. The Afterword to Gylfaginning.</p>

<p>4. Brage’s Speech.</p>

<p>5. The Afterword.</p>

<p>6. Skaldskaparmal (a collection of poetic paraphrases, and
denominations in Skaldic language without paraphrases).</p>

<p>7. Hattatal (an enumeration of metres; a sort of Clavis Metrica).</p>

<p>In some editions there are also found six additional chapters on the
alphabet, grammar, figures of speech, etc.</p>

<p>There are three important parchment manuscripts of the Younger Edda,
viz:</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17"> </a>
1. <i>Codex Regius</i>, the so-called King’s Book. This was presented to
the Royal Library in Copenhagen, by Bishop Brynjulf Sveinsson, in the
year 1640, where it is still kept.</p>

<p>2. <i>Codex Wormianus</i>. This is found in the University Library in
Copenhagen, in the Arne Magnæan collection. It takes its name from
Professor Ole Worm [died 1654], to whom it was presented by the learned
Arngrim Jonsson. Christian Worm, the grandson of Ole Worm, and Bishop of
Seeland [died 1737], afterward presented it to Arne Magnusson.</p>

<p>3. <i>Codex Upsaliensis</i>. This is preserved in the Upsala
University Library. Like the other two, it was found in Iceland, where
it was given to Jon Rugmann. Later it fell into the hands of Count
Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie, who in the year 1669 presented it to the
Upsala University. Besides these three chief documents, there exist four
fragmentary parchments, and a large number of paper manuscripts.</p>

<p>The first printed edition of the Younger Edda, in the original, is
the celebrated “Edda Islandorum,” published by Peter Johannes Resen, in
Copenhagen, in the year 1665. It contains a translation into Latin, made
partly by Resen himself, and partly also by Magnus Olafsson, Stephan
Olafsson and Thormod Torfason.</p>

<p>Not until eighty years later, that is in 1746, did
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18"> </a>
the second edition of the Younger Edda appear in Upsala under the
auspices of Johannes Goransson. This was printed from the Codex
Upsaliensis.</p>

<p>In the present century we find a third edition by Rasmus Rask,
published in Stockholm in 1818. This is very complete and critical. The
fourth edition was issued by Sveinbjorn Egilsson, in Reykjavik, 1849;
the fifth by the Arne-Magnæan Commission in Copenhagen, 1852.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> All these five editions have
long been out of print, and in place of them we have a sixth edition by
Thorleif Jonsson (Copenhagen, 1875), and a seventh by Ernst Wilkin
(Paderborn, 1877). Both of these, and especially the latter, are
thoroughly critical and reliable.</p>

<p>Of translations, we must mention in addition to those into English by
Dasent and Blackwell, R.&nbsp;Nyerup’s translation into Danish
(Copenhagen, 1808); Karl Simrock’s into German (Stuttgart and Tübingen,
1851); and Fr. Bergmann’s into French (Paris, 1871). Among the chief
authorities to be consulted in the study of the Younger Edda may be
named, in addition to those already mentioned, Fr. Dietrich, Th. Mobius,
Fr. Pfeiffer, Ludw. Ettmuller, K.&nbsp;Hildebrand, Ludw. Uhland,
P.&nbsp;E. Muller, Adolf Holzmann, Sophus Bugge, P.&nbsp;A. Munch and
Rudolph Keyser. For the material in our introduction and notes, we are
chiefly
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19"> </a>
indebted to Simrock, Wilkin and Keyser. While we have had no opportunity
of making original researches, the published works have been carefully
studied, and all we claim for our work is, that it shall contain the
results of the latest and most thorough investigations by scholars who
live nearer the fountains of Urd and Mimer than do we. Our translations
are made from Egilsson’s, Jonsson’s and Wilkins’ editions of the
original. We have not translated any of the Hattatal, and only the
narrative part of Skaldskaparmal, and yet our version contains more of
the Younger Edda than any English, German, French or Danish translation
that has hitherto been published. The parts omitted cannot possibly be
of any interest to any one who cannot read them in the original. All the
paraphrases of the asas and asynjes, of the world, the earth, the sea,
the sun, the wind, fire, summer, man, woman, gold, of war, arms, of a
ship, emperor, king, ruler, etc., are of interest only as they help to
explain passages of Old Norse poems. The same is true of the enumeration
of metres, which contains a number of epithets and metaphors used by the
scalds, illustrated by specimens of their poetry, and also by a poem of
Snorre Sturleson, written in one hundred different metres.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of learned discussion in regard to the
authorship of the Younger
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20"> </a>
Edda. Readers specially interested in this knotty subject we must refer
to Wilkins’ elaborate treatise, Untersuchungen zur Snorra Edda
(Paderborn, 1878), and to P.&nbsp;E. Muller’s, Die Æchtheit der Asalehre
(Copenhagen, 1811).</p>

<p>Two celebrated names that without doubt are intimately connected with
the work are Snorre Sturleson and Olaf Thordsson Hvitaskald. Both of
these are conspicuous, not only in the literary, but also in the
political history of Iceland.</p>

<p>Snorre Sturleson<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a>
was born in Iceland in the year 1178. Three years old, he came to the
house of the distinguished chief, Jon Loptsson, at Odde, a grandson of
Sæmund the Wise, the reputed collector of the Elder Edda, where he
appears to have remained until Jon Loptsson’s death, in the year 1197.
Soon afterward Snorre married into a wealthy family, and in a short time
he became one of the most distinguished leaders in Iceland, He was
several times elected chief magistrate, and no man in the land was his
equal in riches and prominence. He and his two elder brothers, Thord and
Sighvat, who were but little inferior to him in wealth and power, were
at one time well-nigh supreme in Iceland, and Snorre sometimes appeared
at the Althing at Thingvols accompanied by from eight hundred to nine
hundred armed&nbsp;men.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21"> </a>
Snorre and his brothers did not only have bitter feuds with other
families, but a deadly hatred also arose between themselves, making
their lives a perpetual warfare. Snorre was shrewd as a politician and
magistrate, and eminent as an orator and skald, but his passions were
mean, and many of his ways were crooked. He was both ambitious and
avaricious. He is said to have been the first Icelander who laid plans
to subjugate his fatherland to Norway, and in this connection is
supposed to have expected to become a jarl under the king of Norway. In
this effort he found himself outwitted by his brother’s son, Sturle
Thordsson, and thus he came into hostile relations with the latter. In
this feud Snorre was defeated, but when Sturle shortly after fell in a
battle against his foes, Snorre’s star of hope rose again, and he began
to occupy himself with far-reaching, ambitious plans. He had been for
the first time in Norway during the years 1218-1220, and had been well
received by King Hakon, and especially by Jarl Skule, who was then the
most influential man in the country. In the year 1237 Snorre visited
Norway again, and entered, as it is believed, into treasonable
conspiracies with Jarl Skule. In 1239 he left Norway against the wishes
of King Hakon, whom he owed obedience, and thereby incurred the king’s
greatest displeasure. When King Hakon, in
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22"> </a>
1240, had crushed Skule’s rebellion and annihilated this dangerous
opponent, it became Snorre’s turn to feel the effects of the king’s
wrath. At the instigation of King Hakon, several chiefs of Iceland
united themselves against Snorre and murdered him at Reykholt, where
ruins of his splendid mansion are still to be seen. This event took
place on the 22d of September, 1241, and Snorre Sturleson was then
sixty-three years old. Snorre was Iceland’s most distinguished skald and
sagaman. As a writer of history he deserves to be compared with
Herodotos or Thukydides. His Heimskringla, embracing an elaborate
history of the kings of Norway, is famous throughout the civilized
world, and Emerson calls it the Iliad and Odyssey of our race. An
English translation of this work was published by Samuel Laing, in
London, in 1844. Carlyle’s Early Kings of Norway (London, 1875) was
inspired by the Heimskringla.</p>

<p>Olaf Thordsson, surnamed Hvitaskald,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3"
href = "#note3">3</a> to distinguish him from his contemporary, Olaf
Svartaskald,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> was a
son of Snorre’s brother. Though not as prominent and influential as his
uncle, he took an active part in all the troubles of his native island
during the first half of the thirteenth century. He visited Norway in
1236, whence he went to Denmark, where he was a guest at the
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23"> </a>
court of King Valdemar, and is said to have enjoyed great esteem. In
1240 we find him again in Norway, where he espoused the cause of King
Hakon against Skule. On his return to Iceland he served four years as
chief magistrate of the island. His death occurred in the year 1259, and
he is numbered among the great skalds of Iceland.</p>

<p>Snorre Sturleson and Olaf Hvitaskald are the two names to whom the
authorship of the Younger Edda has generally been attributed, and the
work is by many, even to this day, called Snorra Edda&mdash;that is,
Snorre’s Edda. We do not propose to enter into any elaborate discussion
of this complicated subject, but we will state briefly the reasons given
by Keyser and others for believing that these men had a hand in
preparing the Prose Edda. In the first place, we find that the writer of
the grammatical and rhetorical part of the Younger Edda distinctly
mentions Snorre as author of Hattatal (the Clavis Metrica), and not only
of the poem itself, but also of the treatise in prose. In the second
place, the Arne Magnæan parchment manuscript, which dates back to the
close of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century, has the
following note prefaced to the Skaldskaparmal. “Here ends that part of
the book which Olaf Thordsson put together, and now begins
Skaldskaparmal and the Kenningar,
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24"> </a>
according to that which has been found in the lays of the chief skalds,
and which Snorre afterward suffered to be brought together.” In the
third place, the Upsala manuscript of the Younger Edda, which is known
with certainty to have been written in the beginning of the fourteenth
century, contains this preface, written with the same hand as the body
of the work: “This book hight Edda. Snorre has compiled it in the manner
in which it is arranged: first, in regard to the asas and Ymer, then
Skaldskaparmal and the denominations of many things, and finally that
Hattatal, which Snorre composed about King Hakon and Duke Skule.” In the
fourth place, there is a passage in the so-called Annales Breviores,
supposed to have been written about the year 1400. The passage relates
to the year 1241, and reads thus: “Snorre Sturleson died at Reykholt. He
was a wise and very learned man, a great chief and shrewd. He was the
first man in this land who brought property into the hands of the king
(the king of Norway). He compiled Edda and many other learned historical
works and Icelandic sagas. He was murdered at Reykholt by Jarl
Gissur’s&nbsp;men.”</p>

<p>It seems, then, that there is no room for any doubt that these two
men have had a share in the authorship of the Younger Edda. How great a
share each has had is another and more difficult
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25"> </a>
problem to solve. Rudolf Keyser’s opinion is (and we know no higher
authority on the subject), that Snorre is the author, though not in so
strict a sense as we now use the word, of Gylfaginning, Brage’s Speech,
Skaldskaparmal and Hattatal. This part of the Younger Edda may thus be
said to date back to the year 1230, though the material out of which the
mythological system is constructed is of course much older. We find it
in the ancient Vala’s Prophecy, of the Elder Edda, a poem that breathes
in every line the purest asa-faith, and is, without the least doubt,
much older than the introduction of christianity in the north, or the
discovery and settlement of Iceland. It is not improbable that the
religious system of the Odinic religion had assumed a permanent prose
form in the memories of the people long before the time of Snorre, and
that he merely was the means of having it committed to writing almost
without verbal change.</p>

<p>Olaf Thordsson is unmistakably the author of the grammatical and
rhetorical portion of the Younger Edda, and its date can therefore
safely be put at about 1250. The author of the treatise on the alphabet
is not known, but Professor Keyser thinks it must have been written, its
first chapter, about the year 1150, and its second chapter about the
year 1200. The forewords and afterwords are evidently also from another
pen.
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26"> </a>
Their author is unknown, but they are thought to have been written about
the year 1300. To sum up, then, we arrive at this conclusion: The
mythological material of the Younger Edda is as old as the Teutonic
race. Parts of it are written by authors unknown to fame. A small
portion is the work of Olaf Thordsson. The most important portion is
written, or perhaps better, compiled, by Snorre Sturleson, and the whole
is finally edited and furnished with forewords and afterwords, early in
the fourteenth century,&mdash;according to Keyser, about 1320-1330.</p>

<p>About the name Edda there has also been much learned discussion. Some
have suggested that it may be a mutilated form of the word Odde, the
home of Sæmund the Wise, who was long supposed to be the compiler of the
Elder Edda. In this connection, it has been argued that possibly Sæmund
had begun the writing of the Younger Edda, too. Others derive the word
from <i>óðr</i> (mind, soul), which in poetical usage also means song,
poetry. Others, again, connect Edda with the Sanscrit word Veda, which
is supposed to mean knowledge. Finally, others adopt the meaning which
the word has where it is actually used in the Elder Edda, and where it
means great-grandmother. Vigfusson adopts this definition, and it is
certainly both scientific and poetical. What can be more beautiful than
the idea
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27"> </a>
that our great ancestress teaches her descendants the sacred traditions,
the concentrated wisdom, of the race? To sum up, then, we say the
Younger, or Prose, or Snorre’s Edda has been produced at different times
by various hands, and the object of its authors has been to produce a
manual for the skalds. In addition to the forewords and afterwords, it
contains two books, one greater (Gylfaginning) and one lesser (Brage’s
Speech), giving a tolerably full account of Norse mythology. Then
follows Skaldskaparmal, wherein is an analysis of the various
circumlocutions practiced by the skalds, all illustrated by copious
quotations from the poets. How much of these three parts is written by
Snorre is not certain, but on the other hand, there is no doubt that he
is the author of Hattatal (Clavis Metrica), which gives an enumeration
of metres. To these four treatises are added four chapters on grammar
and rhetoric. The writer of the oldest grammatical treatise is thought
to be one Thorodd Runemaster, who lived in the middle of the twelfth
century; and the third treatise is evidently written by Olaf Thordsson
Hvitaskald, the nephew of Snorre, a scholar who spent some time at the
court of the Danish king, Valdemar the Victorious.</p>

<p>The Younger Edda contains the systematized theogony and cosmogony of
our forefathers, while the Elder Edda presents the Odinic faith in a
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28"> </a>
series of lays or rhapsodies. The Elder Edda is poetry, while the
Younger Edda is mainly prose. The Younger Edda may in one sense be
regarded as the sequel or commentary of the Elder Edda. Both complement
each other, and both must be studied in connection with the sagas and
all the Teutonic traditions and folk-lore in order to get a
comprehensive idea of the asa-faith. The two Eddas constitute, as it
were, the Odinic Bible. The Elder Edda is the Old Testament, the Younger
Edda the New. Like the Old Testament, the Elder Edda is in poetry. It is
prophetic and enigmatical. Like the New Testament, the Younger Edda is
in prose; it is lucid, and gives a clue to the obscure passages in the
Elder Edda. Nay, in many respects do the two Eddas correspond with the
two Testaments of the Christian Bible.</p>

<p>It is a deplorable fact that the religion of our forefathers seems to
be but little cared for in this country. The mythologies of other
nations every student manifests an interest for. He reads with the
greatest zeal all the legends of Rome and Greece, of India and China. He
is familiar with every room in the labyrinth of Crete, while when he is
introduced to the shining halls of Valhal and Gladsheim he gropes his
way like a blind man. He does not know that Idun, with her beautiful
apples, might, if applied to, render even
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29"> </a>
greater services than Ariadne with her wonderful thread. When we inquire
whom Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday are named after, and
press questions in reference to Tyr, Odin, Thor and Freyja, we get at
best but a wise and knowing look. Are we, then, as a nation, like the
ancient Jews, and do we bend the knee before the gods of foreign nations
and forsake the altars of our own gods? What if we then should suffer
the fate of that unhappy people&mdash;be scattered over all the world
and lose our fatherland? In these Eddas our fathers have bequeathed unto
us all their profoundest, all their sublimest, all their best thought.
They are the concentrated result of their greatest intellectual and
spiritual effort, and it behooves us to cherish this treasure and make
it the fountain at which the whole American branch of the Ygdrasil ash
may imbibe a united national sentiment. It is not enough to brush the
dust off these gods and goddesses of our ancestors and put them up on
pedestals as ornaments in our museums and libraries. These coins of the
past are not to be laid away in numismatic collections. The grandson
must use what he has inherited from his grandfather. If the coin is not
intelligible, then it will have to be sent to the mint and stamped anew,
in order that it may circulate freely. Our
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30"> </a>
ancestral deities want a place in our hearts and in our songs.</p>

<p>On the European continent and in England the zeal of the priests in
propagating Christianity was so great that they sought to root out every
trace of the asa-faith. They left but unintelligible fragments of the
heathen religious structure. Our gods and goddesses and heroes were
consigned to oblivion, and all knowledge of the Odinic religion and of
the Niblung-story would have been well nigh totally obliterated had not
a more lucky star hovered over the destinies of Iceland. In this
remotest corner of the world the ancestral spirit was preserved like the
glowing embers of Hekla beneath the snow and ice of the glacier. From
the farthest Thule the spirit of our fathers rises and shines like an
aurora over all Teutondom. It was in the year 860 that Iceland was
discovered. In 874 the Teutonic spirit fled thither for refuge from
tyranny. Here a government based on the principles of old Teutonic
liberty was established. From here went forth daring vikings, who
discovered Greenland and Vinland, and showed Columbus the way to
America. From here the courts of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, England and
Germany were supplied with skalds to sing their praises. Here was put in
writing the laws and sagas that give us a clue to the form of old
Teutonic institutions. Here was
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31"> </a>
preserved the Old Norse language, and in it a record of the customs, the
institutions and the religion of our fathers. Its literature does not
belong to that island alone,&mdash;it belongs to the whole Teutonic
race! Iceland is for the Teutons what Greece and Rome are for the south
of Europe, and she accomplished her mission with no less efficiency and
success. Cato the Elder used to end all his speeches with these words:
<i>“Præterea censeo Carthaginem esse delendam.”</i> In these days, when
so many worship at the shrine of Romanism, we think it perfectly just to
adopt Cato’s sentence in this form: <i>Præterea censeo Romam esse
delendam</i>.</p>

<p>1. <span class = "firstword">In</span> the beginning Almighty God
created heaven and earth, and all things that belong to them, and last
he made two human beings, from whom the races are descended (Adam and
Eve), and their children multiplied and spread over all the world. But
in the course of time men became unequal; some were good and
right-believing, but many more turned them after the lusts of the world
and heeded not God’s laws; and for this reason God drowned the world in
the flood, and all that was quick in the world, except those who were in
the ark with Noah. After the flood of Noah there lived eight men, who
inhabited the world, and from them the races are descended; and now, as
before, they increased and filled the world, and there were very many
men who loved to covet wealth and power, but turned away from obedience
to God, and so much did they do this that they would not name God. And
who could then tell their sons of the wonderful works of God? So it came
to pass that they lost God’s name; and in the wide world the man was not
to be found who could tell of his
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34"> </a>
Maker. But, nevertheless, God gave them earthly-gifts, wealth and
happiness, that should be with them in the world; he also shared wisdom
among them, so that they understood all earthly things, and all kinds
that might be seen in the air and on the earth. This they thought upon,
and wondered at, how it could come to pass that the earth and the beasts
and the birds had the same nature in some things but still were unlike
in manners.</p>

<p>One evidence of this nature was that the earth might be dug into upon
high mountain-peaks and water would spring up there, and it was not
necessary to dig deeper for water there than in deep dales; thus, also,
in beasts and birds it is no farther to the blood in the head than in
the feet. Another proof of this nature is, that every year there grow on
the earth grass and flowers, and the same year it falls and withers;
thus, also, on beasts and birds do hair and feathers grow and fall off
each year. The third nature of the earth is, that when it is opened and
dug into, then grass grows on the mould which is uppermost on the earth.
Rocks and stones they explained to correspond to the teeth and bones of
living things. From these things they judged that the earth must be
quick and must have life in some way, and they knew that it was of a
wonderfully great age and of a mighty nature. It nourished all that was
quick and took to itself
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35"> </a>
all that died. On this account they gave it a name, and numbered their
ancestors back to it This they also learned from their old kinsmen, that
when many hundred winters were numbered, the course of the heavenly
bodies was uneven; some had a longer course than others. From such
things they suspected that some one must be the ruler of the heavenly
bodies who could stay their course at his own will, and he must be
strong and mighty; and of him they thought that, if he ruled the prime
elements, he must also have been before the heavenly bodies, and they
saw that, if he ruled the course of the heavenly bodies, he must rule
the sunshine, and the dew of the heavens, and the products of the earth
that follow them; and thus, also, the winds of the air and therewith the
storms of the sea. They knew not where his realm was, but they believed
that he ruled over all things on the earth and in the air, over the
heavens and the heavenly bodies, the seas and the weather. But in order
that these things might be better told and remembered, they gave him the
same name with themselves, and this belief has been changed in many
ways, as the peoples have been separated and the tongues have been
divided.</p>

<p>2. In his old age Noah shared the world with his sons: for Ham he
intended the western region, for Japheth the northern region, but for
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36"> </a>
Shem the southern region, with those parts which will hereafter be
marked out in the division of the earth into three parts. In the time
that the sons of these men were in the world, then increased forthwith
the desire for riches and power, from the fact that they knew many
crafts that had not been discovered before, and each one was exalted
with his own handiwork; and so far did they carry their pride, that the
Africans, descended from Ham, harried in that part of the world which
the offspring of Shem, their kinsman, inhabited. And when they had
conquered them, the world seemed to them too small, and they smithied a
tower with tile and stone, which they meant should reach to heaven, on
the plain called Sennar. And when this building was so far advanced that
it extended above the air, and they were no less eager to continue the
work, and when God saw how their pride waxed high, then he sees that he
will have to strike it down in some way. And the same God, who is
almighty, and who might have struck down all their work in the twinkling
of an eye, and made themselves turn into dust, still preferred to
frustrate their purpose by making them realize their own littleness, in
that none of them should understand what the other talked; and thus no
one knew what the other commanded, and one broke what the other wished
to build up, until they came
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37"> </a>
to strife among themselves, and therewith was frustrated, in the
beginning, their purpose of building a tower. And he who was foremost,
hight Zoroaster, he laughed before he wept when he came into the world;
but the master-smiths were seventy-two, and so many tongues have spread
over the world since the giants were dispersed over the land, and the
nations became numerous. In this same place was built the most famous
city, which took its name from the tower, and was called Babylon. And
when the confusion of tongues had taken place, then increased the names
of men and of other things, and this same Zoroaster had many names; and
although he understood that his pride was laid low by the said building,
still he worked his way unto worldly power, and had himself chosen king
over many peoples of the Assyrians. From him arose the error of
idolatry; and when he was worshiped he was called Baal; we call him Bel;
he also had many other names. But as the names increased in number, so
was truth lost; and from this first error every following man worshiped
his head-master, beasts or birds, the air and the heavenly bodies, and
various lifeless things, until the error at length spread over the whole
world; and so carefully did they lose the truth that no one knew his
maker, excepting those men alone who spoke the Hebrew tongue,&mdash;that
which
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38"> </a>
flourished before the building of the tower,&mdash;and still they did
not lose the bodily endowments that were given them, and therefore they
judged of all things with earthly understanding, for spiritual wisdom
was not given unto them. They deemed that all things were smithied of
some one material.</p>

<p>3. The world was divided into three parts, one from the south,
westward to the Mediterranean Sea, which part was called Africa; but the
southern portion of this part is hot and scorched by the sun. The second
part, from the west and to the north and to the sea, is that called
Europe, or Enea. The northern portion of this is cold, so that grass
grows not, nor can anyone dwell there. From the north around the east
region, and all to the south, that is called Asia. In that part of the
world is all beauty and pomp, and wealth of the earth’s products, gold
and precious stones. There is also the mid-world, and as the earth there
is fairer and of a better quality than elsewhere, so are also the people
there most richly endowed with all gifts, with wisdom and strength, with
beauty and with all knowledge.</p>

<p>4. Near the middle of the world was built the house and inn, the most
famous that has been made, which was called Troy, in the land which we
call Turkey. This city was built much larger than others, with more
skill in many ways, at
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39"> </a>
great expense, and with such means as were at hand. There were twelve
kingdoms and one over-king, and many lands and nations belonged to each
kingdom; there were in the city twelve chief languages.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> Their chiefs have surpassed all men
who have been in the world in all heroic things. No scholar who has ever
told of these things has ever disputed this fact, and for this reason,
that all rulers of the north region trace their ancestors back thither,
and place in the number of the gods all who were rulers of the city.
Especially do they place Priamos himself in the stead of Odin; nor must
that be called wonderful, for Priamos was sprung from Saturn, him whom
the north region for a long time believed to be God himself.</p>

<p>5. This Saturn grew up in that island in Greece which hight Crete. He
was greater and stronger and fairer than other men. As in other natural
endowments, so he excelled all men in wisdom. He invented many crafts
which had not before been discovered. He was also so great in the art of
magic that he was certain about things that had not yet come to pass. He
found, too, that red thing in the earth from which he smelted gold, and
from such things he soon became very mighty. He also foretold harvests
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40"> </a>
and many other secret things, and for such, and many other deeds, he was
chosen chief of the island. And when he had ruled it a short time, then
there speedily enough became a great abundance of all things. No money
circulated excepting gold coins, so plentiful was this metal; and though
there was famine in other lands, the crops never failed in Crete, so
that people might seek there all the things which they needed to have.
And from this and many other secret gifts of power that he had, men
believed him to be God, and from him arose another error among the
Cretans and Macedonians like the one before mentioned among the
Assyrians and Chaldeans from Zoroaster. And when Saturn finds how great
strength the people think they have in him, he calls himself God, and
says that he rules heaven and earth and all things.</p>

<p>6. Once he went to Greece in a ship, for there was a king’s daughter
on whom he had set his heart. He won her love in this way, that one day
when she was out with her maid-servants, he took upon himself the
likeness of a bull, and lay before her in the wood, and so fair was he
that the hue of gold was on every hair; and when the king’s daughter saw
him she patted his lips. He sprang up and threw off the bull’s likeness
and took her into his arms and bore her to the ship and took her to
Crete. But his wife, Juno,
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41"> </a>
found this out, so he turned her (the king’s daughter) into the likeness
of a heifer and sent her east to the arms of the great river (that is,
of the Nile, to the Nile country), and let the thrall, who hight
Argulos, take care of her. She was there twelve months before he changed
her shape again. Many things did he do like this, or even more wonderful
He had three sons: one hight Jupiter, another Neptune, the third Pluto.
They were all men of the greatest accomplishments, and Jupiter was by
far the greatest; he was a warrior and won many kingdoms; he was also
crafty like his father, and took upon himself the likeness of many
animals, and thus he accomplished many things which are impossible for
mankind; and on account of this, and other things, he was held in awe by
all nations. Therefore Jupiter is put in the place of Thor, since all
evil wights fear&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>7. Saturn had built in Crete seventy-two burgs, and when he thought
himself firmly established in his kingdom, he shared it with his sons,
whom he set up with himself as gods; and to Jupiter he gave the realm of
heaven; to Neptune, the realm of the earth, and to Pluto, hell; and this
last seemed to him the worst to manage, and therefore he gave to him his
dog, the one whom he called Cerberos, to guard hell. This Cerberos, the
Greeks say, Herakles dragged out of hell and
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42"> </a>
upon earth. And although Saturn had given the realm of heaven to
Jupiter, the latter nevertheless desired to possess the realm of the
earth, and so he harried his father’s kingdom, and it is said that he
had him taken and emasculated, and for such great achievements he
declared himself to be god, and the Macedonians say that he had the
members taken and cast into the sea, and therefore they believed for
ages that therefrom had come a woman; her they called Venus, and
numbered among the gods, and she has in all ages since been called
goddess of love, for they believed she was able to turn the hearts of
all men and women to love. When Saturn was emasculated by Jupiter, his
son, he fled from the east out of Crete and west into Italy. There dwelt
at that time such people as did not work, and lived on acorns and grass,
and lay in caves or holes in the earth. And when Saturn came there he
changed his name and called himself Njord, for the reason that he
thought that Jupiter, his son, might afterward seek him out. He was the
first there to teach men to plow and plant vineyards. There the soil was
good and fresh, and it soon produced heavy crops. He was made chief and
thus he got possession of all the realms there and built many burgs.</p>

<p>8. Jupiter, his son, had many sons, from whom races have descended;
his son was Dardanos, his
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page43"> </a>
son Herikon, his son Tros, his son Ilos, his son Laomedon, the father of
the chief king Priamos. Priamos had many sons; one of them was Hektor,
who was the most famous of all men in the world for strength, and
stature and accomplishments, and for all manly deeds of a knightly kind;
and it is found written that when the Greeks and all the strength of the
north and east regions fought with the Trojans, they would never have
become victors had not the Greeks invoked the gods; and it is also
stated that no human strength would conquer them unless they were
betrayed by their own men, which afterward was done. And from their fame
men that came after gave themselves titles, and especially was this done
by the Romans, who were the most famous in many things after their days;
and it is said that, when Rome was built, the Romans adapted their
customs and laws as nearly as possible to those of the Trojans, their
forefathers. And so much power accompanied these men for many ages
after, that when Pompey, a Roman chieftain, harried in the east region,
Odin fled out of Asia and hither to the north country, and then he gave
to himself and his men their names, and said that Priamos had hight Odin
and his queen Frigg, and from this the realm afterward took its name and
was called Frigia where the burg stood. And whether Odin said
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44"> </a>
this of himself out of pride, or that it was wrought by the changing of
tongues; nevertheless many wise men have regarded it a true saying, and
for a long time after every man who was a great chieftain followed his
example.</p>

<p>9. A king in Troy hight Munon or Mennon, his wife was a daughter of
the head-king Priamos and hight Troan; they had a son who hight Tror,
him we call Thor. He was fostered in Thrace by the duke, who is called
Loricos. But when he was ten winters old he took his father’s weapons.
So fair of face was he, when he stood by other men, as when ivory is set
in oak; his hair was fairer than gold. When he was twelve winters old he
had full strength; then he lifted from the ground ten bear skins all at
once, and then he slew Loricos, the duke, his foster-father and his
wife, Lora or Glora, and took possession of Thrace; this we call
Thrudheim. Then he visited many lands and knew the countries of the
world, and conquered single-handed all the berserks and all the giants,
and one very big dragon and many beasts. In the north region he found
that prophetess who hight Sibyl, whom we call Sif, and married her. None
can tell the genealogy of Sif; she was the fairest of all women, her
hair was like gold. Their son was Loride (Hloride), who was like his
father; his son was Henrede; his son Vingethor (Vingthor);
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45"> </a>
his son Vingener (Vingner); his son Moda (Mode); his son Magi (Magne);
his son Kesfet; his son Bedvig; his son Atra, whom we call Annan; his
son Itrman; his son Heremod (Hermod); his son Skjaldun, whom we call
Skjold; his son Bjaf, whom we call Bjar; his son Jat; his son Gudolf,
his son Fjarlaf, whom we call Fridleif; he had the son who is called
Vodin, whom we call Odin; he was a famous man for wisdom and all
accomplishments. His wife hight Frigida, whom we call Frigg.</p>

<p>10. Odin had the power of divination, and so had his wife, and from
this knowledge he found out that his name would be held high in the
north part of the world, and honored beyond that of all kings. For this
reason he was eager to begin his journey from Turkey, and he had with
him very many people, young and old, men and women, and he had with him
many costly things. But wherever they fared over the lands great fame
was spoken of them, and they were said to be more like gods than men.
And they stopped not on their journey before they came north into that
land which is now called Saxland; there Odin remained a long time, and
subjugated the country far and wide. There Odin established his three
sons as a defense of the land. One is named Veggdegg; he was a strong
king and ruled over East Saxland. His son was
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46"> </a>
Vitrgils, and his sons were Ritta, the father of Heingest (Hengist), and
Sigar, the father of Svebdegg, whom we call Svipdag. Another son of Odin
hight Beldegg, whom we call Balder; he possessed the land which now
hight Vestfal; his son was Brander, and his son Frjodigar, whom we call
Froda (Frode). His son was Freovit, his son Yvigg, his son Gevis, whom
we call Gave. The third son of Odin is named Sigge, his son Verer. These
forefathers ruled the land which is now called Frankland, and from them
is come the race that is called the Volsungs. From all of these many and
great races are descended.</p>

<p>11. Then Odin continued his journey northward and came into the
country which was called Reidgotaland, and in that land he conquered all
that he desired. He established there his son, who hight Skjold; his son
hight Fridleif; from him is descended the race which hight Skjoldungs;
these are the Dane kings, and that land hight now Jutland, which then
was called Reidgotaland.</p>

<p>12. Thereupon he fared north to what is now called Svithjod (Sweden),
there was the king who is called Gylfe. But when he heard of the coming
of those Asiamen, who were called asas, he went to meet them, and
offered Odin such things in his kingdom as he himself might desire.
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47"> </a>
And such good luck followed their path, that wherever they stopped in
the lands, there were bountiful crops and good peace; and all believed
that they were the cause thereof. The mighty men of the kingdom saw that
they were unlike other men whom they had seen, both in respect to beauty
and understanding. The land there seemed good to Odin, and he chose
there for himself a place for a burg, which is now called Sigtuna.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> He there established
chiefs, like unto what had formerly existed in Troy; he appointed twelve
men in the burg to be judges of the law of the land, and made all rights
to correspond with what had before been in Troy, and to what the Turks
had been accustomed.</p>

<p>13. Thereupon he fared north until he reached the sea, which they
thought surrounded all lands, and there he established his son in the
kingdom, which is now called Norway; he is hight Saming, and the kings
of Norway count their ancestors back to him, and so do the jarls and
other mighty men, as it is stated in the Haleygjatal.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> But Odin had with him that son who
is called Yngve, who was king in Sweden, and from him is descended the
families called Ynglings (Yngvelings). The asas took to themselves wives
there within the land. But some took
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48"> </a>
wives for their sons, and these families became so numerous that they
spread over Saxland, and thence over the whole north region, and the
tongue of these Asiamen became the native tongue of all these lands. And
men think they can understand from the way in which the names of their
forefathers is written, that these names have belonged to this tongue,
and that the asas have brought this tongue hither to the north, to
Norway, to Sweden and to Saxland. But in England are old names of places
and towns which can be seen to have been given in another tongue than
this.</p>

<h6>GEFJUN’S PLOWING.</h6>

<p>1. King Gylfe ruled the lands that are now called Svithjod (Sweden).
Of him it is said that he gave to a wayfaring woman, as a reward for the
entertainment she had afforded him by her story-telling, a plow-land in
his realm, as large as four oxen could plow it in a day and a night But
this woman was of the asa-race; her name was Gefjun. She took from the
north, from Jotunheim, four oxen, which were the sons of a giant and
her, and set them before the plow. Then went the plow so hard and deep
that it tore up the land, and the oxen drew it westward into the sea,
until it stood still in a sound. There Gefjun set the land, gave it a
name and called it Seeland. And where the land had been taken away
became afterward a sea, which in Sweden is now called Logrinn (the Lake,
the Malar Lake in Sweden). And in the Malar Lake the bays correspond
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50"> </a>
to the capes in Seeland. Thus Brage, the old skald:</p>

<p class = "verse">

<h6>GYLFE’S JOURNEY TO ASGARD.</h6>

<p>2. King Gylfe was a wise man and skilled in the black art. He
wondered much that the asa-folk was so mighty in knowledge, that all
things went after their will. He thought to himself whether this could
come from their own nature, or whether the cause must be sought for
among the gods whom they worshiped. He therefore undertook a journey to
Asgard. He went secretly, having assumed the likeness of an old man, and
striving thus to disguise himself. But the asas were wiser, for they see
into the future, and, foreseeing his journey before he came, they
received him with an eye-deceit. So when he came into the burg he saw
there a hall so high that he could hardly look over it. Its roof was
thatched with golden shields as with shingles. Thus says Thjodolf of
Hvin, that Valhal was thatched with shields:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Thinking thatchers<br>
Thatched the roof;<br>
The beams of the burg<br>
Beamed with gold.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52"> </a>
In the door of the hall Gylfe saw a man who played with swords so
dexterously that seven were in the air at one time. That man asked him
what his name was. Gylfe answered that his name was Ganglere;<a class =
"tag" name = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> that he had come a long
way, and that he sought lodgings for the night. He also asked who owned
the burg. The other answered that it belonged to their king: I will go
with you to see him and then you may ask him for his name yourself. Then
the man turned and led the way into the hall. Ganglere followed, and
suddenly the doors closed behind him. There he saw many rooms and a
large number of people, of whom some were playing, others were drinking,
and some were fighting with weapons. He looked around him, and much of
what he saw seemed to him incredible. Then quoth he:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Gates all,<br>
Before in you go,<br>
You must examine well;<br>
For you cannot know<br>
Where enemies sit<br>
In the house before you.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" href =
"#note11">11</a>
</p>

<p>He saw three high-seats, one above the other, and in each sat a man.
He asked what the names of these chiefs were. He, who had conducted him
in, answered that the one who sat
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53"> </a>
in the lowest high-seat was king, and hight Har; the one next above him,
Jafnhar; but the one who sat on the highest throne, Thride. Har asked
the comer what more his errand was, and added that food and drink was
there at his service, as for all in Har’s hall. Ganglere answered that
he first would like to ask whether there was any wise man. Answered Har:
You will not come out from here hale unless you are wiser.</p>

<p class = "verse">
And stand now forth<br>
While you ask;<br>
He who answers shall sit.
</p>




<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54"> </a>
<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h6>OF THE HIGHEST GOD.</h6>

<p>3. Ganglere then made the following question: Who is the highest and
oldest of all the gods? Made answer Har: Alfather he is called in our
tongue, but in Asgard of old he had twelve names. The first is Alfather,
the second is Herran or Herjan, the third Nikar or Hnikar, the fourth
Nikuz or Hnikud, the fifth Fjolner, the sixth Oske, the seventh Ome, the
eighth Biflide or Biflinde, the ninth Svidar, the tenth Svidrer, the
eleventh Vidrer, the twelfth Jalg or Jalk. Ganglere asks again: Where is
this god? What can he do? What mighty works has he accomplished?
Answered Har: He lives from everlasting to everlasting, rules over all
his realm, and governs all things, great and small. Then remarked
Jafnhar: He made heaven and earth, the air and all things in them.
Thride added: What is most important, he made man and gave him a spirit,
which shall live, and never perish, though the body may turn to dust or
burn to ashes. All who live a life of virtue shall dwell with him in
Gimle or Vingolf. The wicked,
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55"> </a>
on the other hand, go to Hel, and from her to Niflhel, that is, down
into the ninth world. Then asked Ganglere: What was he doing before
heaven and earth were made? Har gave answer: Then was he with the
frost-giants.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56"> </a>
<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h6>THE CREATION OF THE WORLD.</h6>

<p>4. Said Ganglere: How came the world into existence, or how did it
rise? What was before? Made answer to him Har: Thus is it said in the
Vala’s Prophecy:</p>

<p class = "verse">
It was Time’s morning,<br>
When there nothing was;<br>
Nor sand, nor sea,<br>
Nor cooling billows.<br>
Earth there was not,<br>
Nor heaven above.<br>
The Ginungagap was,<br>
But grass nowhere.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a>
</p>

<p>Jafnhar remarked: Many ages before the earth was made, Niflheim had
existed, in the midst of which is the well called Hvergelmer, whence
flow the following streams: Svol, Gunnthro, Form, Fimbul, Thul, Slid and
Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid, Leipt and Gjoll, the last of which is nearest
the gate of Hel. Then added Thride: Still there was before a world to
the south which hight Muspelheim. It is light and hot, and so bright and
dazzling that no stranger, who is not a
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57"> </a>
native there, can stand it. Surt is the name of him who stands on its
border guarding it. He has a flaming sword in his hand, and at the end
of the world he will come and harry, conquer all the gods, and burn up
the whole world with fire. Thus it is said in the Vala’s Prophecy:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Surt from the south fares<br>
With blazing flames;<br>
From the sword shines<br>
The sun of the war-god.<br>
Rocks dash together<br>
And witches collapse,<br>
Men go the way to Hel<br>
And the heavens are cleft.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" href =
"#note13">13</a>
</p>

<p>5. Said Ganglere: What took place before the races came into
existence, and men increased and multiplied? Replied Har, explaining,
that as soon as the streams, that are called the Elivogs, had come so
far from their source that the venomous yeast which flowed with them
hardened, as does dross that runs from the fire, then it turned into
ice. And when this ice stopped and flowed no more, then gathered over it
the drizzling rain that arose from the venom and froze into rime, and
one layer of ice was laid upon the other clear into Ginungagap. Then
said Jafnhar: All that part of Ginungagap that turns toward the north
was filled with thick and heavy ice and rime, and everywhere within were
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58"> </a>
drizzling rains and gusts. But the south part of Ginungagap was lighted
up by the glowing sparks that flew out of Muspelheim. Added Thride: As
cold and all things grim proceeded from Niflheim, so that which bordered
on Muspelheim was hot and bright, and Ginungagap was as warm and mild as
windless air. And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime,
so that it melted into drops, then, by the might of him who sent the
heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man, who
got the name Ymer. But the Frost giants call him Aurgelmer. Thus it is
said in the short Prophecy of the Vala (the Lay of Hyndla):</p>

<p class = "verse">
All the valas are<br>
From Vidolf descended;<br>
All wizards are<br>
Of Vilmeide’s race;<br>
All enchanters<br>
Are sons of Svarthofde;<br>
All giants have<br>
Come from Ymer.<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a>
</p>

<p>And on this point, when Vafthrudner, the giant, was asked by
Gangrad:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Whence came Aurgelmer<br>
Originally to the sons<br>
Of the giants?&mdash;thou wise giant!<a class = "tag" name = "tag15"
href = "#note15">15</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59"> </a>
he said</p>

<p class = "verse">
From the Elivogs<br>
Sprang drops of venom,<br>
And grew till a giant was made.<br>
Thence our race<br>
Are all descended,<br>
Therefore are we all so fierce.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" href =
"#note16">16</a>
</p>

<p>Then asked Ganglere: How were the races developed from him? Or what
was done so that more men were made? Or do you believe him to be god of
whom you now spake? Made answer Har: By no means do we believe him to be
god; evil was he and all his offspring, them we call frost-giants. It is
said that when he slept he fell into a sweat, and then there grew under
his left arm a man and a woman, and one of his feet begat with the other
a son. From these come the races that are called frost-giants. The old
frost-giant we call Ymer.</p>

<p>6. Then said Ganglere: Where did Ymer dwell, and on what did he live?
Answered Har: The next thing was that when the rime melted into drops,
there was made thereof a cow, which hight Audhumbla. Four milk-streams
ran from her teats, and she fed Ymer. Thereupon asked Ganglere: On what
did the cow subsist? Answered Har: She licked the salt-stones that were
covered with rime, and the first day that she
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60"> </a>
licked the stones there came out of them in the evening a man’s hair,
the second day a man’s head, and the third day the whole man was there.
This man’s name was Bure; he was fair of face, great and mighty, and he
begat a son whose name was Bor. This Bor married a woman whose name was
Bestla, the daughter of the giant Bolthorn; they had three
sons,&mdash;the one hight Odin, the other Vile, and the third Ve. And it
is my belief that this Odin and his brothers are the rulers of heaven
and earth. We think that he must be so called. That is the name of the
man whom we know to be the greatest and most famous, and well may men
call him by that name.</p>

<p>7. Ganglere asked: How could these keep peace with Ymer, or who was
the stronger? Then answered Har: The sons of Bor slew the giant Ymer,
but when he fell, there flowed so much blood from his wounds that they
drowned therein the whole race of frost giants; excepting one, who
escaped with his household. Him the giants call Bergelmer. He and his
wife went on board his ark and saved themselves in it. From them are
come new races of frost-giants, as is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Countless winters<br>
Ere the earth was made,<br>
Was born Bergelmer.
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61"> </a><br>
This first I call to mind<br>
How that crafty giant<br>
Safe in his ark lay.<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" href =
"#note17">17</a>
</p>

<p>8. Then said Ganglere: What was done then by the sons of Bor, since
you believe that they were gods? Answered Har: About that there is not a
little to be said. They took the body of Ymer, carried it into the midst
of Ginungagap and made of him the earth. Of his blood they made the seas
and lakes; of his flesh the earth was made, but of his bones the rocks;
of his teeth and jaws, and of the bones that were broken, they made
stones and pebbles. Jafnhar remarked: Of the blood that flowed from the
wounds, and was free, they made the ocean; they fastened the earth
together and around it they laid this ocean in a ring without, and it
must seem to most men impossible to cross it. Thride added: They took
his skull and made thereof the sky, and raised it over the earth with
four sides. Under each corner they set a dwarf, and the four dwarfs were
called Austre (east), Vestre (West), Nordre (North), Sudre (South). Then
they took glowing sparks, that were loose and had been cast out from
Muspelheim, and placed them in the midst of the boundless heaven, both
above and below, to light up heaven and earth. They gave resting-places
to all fires, and set some in heaven;
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62"> </a>
some were made to go free under heaven, but they gave them a place and
shaped their course. In old songs it is said that from that time days
and years were reckoned. Thus in the Prophecy of the Vala:</p>

<p class = "verse">
The sun knew not<br>
Where her hall she had;<br>
The moon knew not<br>
What might he had;<br>
The stars knew not<br>
Their resting-places.<a class = "tag" name = "tag18" href =

</p>

<p>Thus it was before these things were made. Then said Ganglere:
Wonderful tidings are these I now hear; a wondrous great building is
this, and deftly constructed. How was the earth fashioned? Made answer
Har: The earth is round, and without it round about lies the deep ocean,
and along the outer strand of that sea they gave lands for the giant
races to dwell in; and against the attack of restless giants they built
a burg within the sea and around the earth. For this purpose they used
the giant Ymer’s eyebrows, and they called the burg Midgard. They also
took his brains and cast them into the air, and made therefrom the
clouds, as is here said:</p>

<h6>THE CREATION&mdash;(CONTINUED.)</h6>

<p>9. Then said Ganglere: Much had been done, it seemed to me, when
heaven and earth were made, when sun and moon were set in their places,
and when days were marked out; but whence came the people who inhabit
the world? Har answered as follows: As Bor’s sons went along the
sea-strand, they found two trees. These trees they took up and made men
of them. The first gave them spirit and life; the second endowed them
with reason and power of motion; and the third gave them form, speech,
hearing and eyesight. They gave them clothes and names; the man they
called Ask, and the woman Embla. From them all mankind is descended, and
a dwelling-place was given them under Midgard. In the next place, the
sons of Bor made for themselves in the middle of the world a burg, which
is called Asgard, and which we call Troy. There dwelt the gods and their
race, and thence were wrought many tidings and adventures, both on earth
and in the sky. In Asgard is a place called Hlidskjalf, and when
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65"> </a>
Odin seated himself there in the high-seat, he saw over the whole world,
and what every man was doing, and he knew all things that he saw. His
wife hight Frigg, and she was the daughter of Fjorgvin, and from their
offspring are descended the race that we call asas, who inhabited Asgard
the old and the realms that lie about it, and all that race are known to
be gods. And for this reason Odin is called Alfather, that he is the
father of all gods and men, and of all things that were made by him and
by his might. Jord (earth) was his daughter and his wife; with her he
begat his first son, and that is Asa-Thor. To him was given force and
strength, whereby he conquers all things quick.</p>

<p>10. Norfe, or Narfe, hight a giant, who dwelt in Jotunheim. He had a
daughter by name Night. She was swarthy and dark like the race she
belonged to. She was first married to a man who hight Naglfare. Their
son was Aud. Afterward she was married to Annar. Jord hight their
daughter. Her last husband was Delling (Daybreak), who was of asa-race.
Their son was Day, who was light and fair after his father. Then took
Alfather Night and her son Day, gave them two horses and two cars, and
set them up in heaven to drive around the earth, each in twelve hours by
turns. Night rides first on the horse which is called Hrimfaxe, and
every morning he bedews
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66"> </a>
the earth with the foam from his bit. The horse on which Day rides is
called Skinfaxe, and with his mane he lights up all the sky and the
earth.</p>

<p>11. Then said Ganglere: How does he steer the course of the sun and
the moon? Answered Har: Mundilfare hight the man who had two children.
They were so fair and beautiful that he called his son Moon, and his
daughter, whom he gave in marriage to a man by name Glener, he called
Sun. But the gods became wroth at this arrogance, took both the brother
and the sister, set them up in heaven, and made Sun drive the horses
that draw the car of the sun, which the gods had made to light up the
world from sparks that flew out of Muspelheim. These horses hight Arvak
and Alsvid. Under their withers the gods placed two wind-bags to cool
them, but in some songs it is called ironcold (ísarnkol). Moon guides
the course of the moon, and rules its waxing and waning. He took from
the earth two children, who hight Bil and Hjuke, as they were going from
the well called Byrger, and were carrying on their shoulders the bucket
called Sager and the pole Simul. Their father’s name is Vidfin. These
children always accompany Moon, as can be seen from the earth.</p>

<p>12. Then said Ganglere: Swift fares Sun, almost as if she were
afraid, and she could make no more haste in her course if she feared her
destroyer.
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67"> </a>
Then answered Har: Nor is it wonderful that she speeds with all her
might. Near is he who pursues her, and there is no escape for her but to
run before him. Then asked Ganglere: Who causes her this toil? Answered
Har: It is two wolves. The one hight Skol, he runs after her; she fears
him and he will one day overtake her. The other hight Hate, Hrodvitner’s
son; he bounds before her and wants to catch the moon, and so he will at
last.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" href = "#note20">20</a> Then asked
Ganglere: Whose offspring are these wolves? Said Har; A hag dwells east
of Midgard, in the forest called Jarnved (Ironwood), where reside the
witches called Jarnvidjes. The old hag gives birth to many giant sons,
and all in wolf’s likeness. Thence come these two wolves. It is said
that of this wolf-race one is the mightiest, and is called Moongarm. He
is filled with the life-blood of all dead men. He will devour the moon,
and stain the heavens and all the sky with blood. Thereby the sun will
be darkened, the winds will grow wild, and roar hither and thither, as
it is said in the Prophecy of the Vala:</p>

<p class = "verse">

</p>

<p>13. Then asked Ganglere: What is the path from earth to heaven? Har
answered, laughing: Foolishly do you now ask. Have you not been told
that the gods made a bridge from earth to heaven, which is called
Bifrost? You must have seen it. It may be that you call it the rainbow.
It has three colors, is very strong, and is made with more craft and
skill than other structures. Still, however strong it is, it will break
when the sons of Muspel come to ride over it, and then they will have to
swim their horses over great rivers in order to get on. Then said
Ganglere: The gods did not, it seems to me, build that bridge honestly,
if it shall be able to break to pieces, since they could have done so,
had they desired. Then made answer Har: The gods are worthy of no blame
for this structure. Bifrost is indeed a good bridge, but there is no
thing in the world that is able to stand when the sons of Muspel come to
the fight.</p>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h6>THE FIRST WORKS OF THE ASAS. THE GOLDEN AGE.</h6>

<p>14. Then said Ganglere: What did Alfather do when Asgard had been
built? Said Har: In the beginning he appointed rulers in a place in the
middle of the burg which is called Idavold, who were to judge with him
the disputes of men and decide the affairs of the burg. Their first work
was to erect a court, where there were seats for all the twelve, and,
besides, a high-seat for Alfather. That is the best and largest house
ever built on earth, and is within and without like solid gold. This
place is called Gladsheim. Then they built another hall as a home for
the goddesses, which also is a very beautiful mansion, and is called
Vingolf. Thereupon they built a forge; made hammer, tongs, anvil, and
with these all other tools. Afterward they worked in iron, stone and
wood, and especially in that metal which is called gold. All their
household wares were of gold. That age was called the golden age, until
it was lost by the coming of those women from Jotunheim. Then the gods
set themselves in their high-seats and held counsel.
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70"> </a>
They remembered how the dwarfs had quickened in the mould of the earth
like maggots in flesh. The dwarfs had first been created and had
quickened in Ymer’s flesh, and were then maggots; but now, by the
decision of the gods, they got the understanding and likeness of men,
but still had to dwell in the earth and in rocks. Modsogner was one
dwarf and Durin another. So it is said in the Vala’s Prophecy:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Then went all the gods,<br>
The all-holy gods,<br>
On their judgment seats,<br>
And thereon took counsel<br>
Who should the race<br>
Of dwarfs create<br>
From the bloody sea<br>
And from Blain’s bones.<br>
In the likeness of men<br>
Made they many<br>
Dwarfs in the earth,<br>
As Durin said.
</p>

<p>And these, says the Vala, are the names of the dwarfs:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Nye, Nide,<br>
Nordre, Sudre,<br>
Austre, Vestre,<br>
Althjof, Dvalin,<br>

<h6>ON THE WONDERFUL THINGS IN HEAVEN.</h6>

<p>15. Then said Ganglere: Where is the chief or most holy place of the
gods? Har answered: That is by the ash Ygdrasil. There the gods meet in
council every day. Said Ganglere: What is said about this place?
Answered Jafnhar: This ash is the best and greatest of all trees; its
branches spread over all the world, and reach up above heaven. Three
roots sustain the tree and stand wide apart; one root is with the asas
and another with the frost-giants, where Ginungagap formerly was; the
third reaches into Niflheim; under it is Hvergelmer, where Nidhug gnaws
the root from below. But under the second root, which extends to the
frost-giants, is the well of Mimer, wherein knowledge and wisdom are
concealed. The owner of the well hight Mimer. He is full of wisdom, for
he drinks from the well with the Gjallar-horn. Alfather once came there
and asked for a drink from the well, but he did not get it before he
left one of his eyes as a pledge. So it is said in the Vala’s
Prophecy:</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73"> </a></p>
<p class = "verse">
Well know I, Odin,<br>
Where you hid your eye:<br>
In the crystal-clear<br>
Well of Mimer.<br>
Mead drinks Mimer<br>
Every morning<br>
From Valfather’s pledge.<br>
Know you yet or not?<a class = "tag" name = "tag23" href =
"#note23">23</a>
</p>

<p>The third root of the ash is in heaven, and beneath it is the most
sacred fountain of Urd. Here the gods have their doomstead. The asas
ride hither every day over Bifrost, which is also called Asa-bridge. The
following are the names of the horses of the gods: Sleipner is the best
one; he belongs to Odin, and he has eight feet. The second is Glad, the
third Gyller, the fourth Gler, the fifth Skeidbrimer, the sixth
Silfertop, the seventh Siner, the eighth Gisl, the ninth Falhofner, the
tenth Gulltop, the eleventh Letfet. Balder’s horse was burned with him.
Thor goes on foot to the doomstead, and wades the following rivers:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Kormt and Ormt<br>
And the two Kerlaugs;<br>
These shall Thor wade<br>
Every day<br>

"#note24">24</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74"> </a>
Then asked Ganglere: Does fire burn over Bifrost? Har answered: The red
which you see in the rainbow is burning fire. The frost-giants and the
mountain-giants would go up to heaven if Bifrost were passable for all
who desired to go there. Many fair places there are in heaven, and they
are all protected by a divine defense. There stands a beautiful hall
near the fountain beneath the ash. Out of it come three maids, whose
names are Urd, Verdande and Skuld. These maids shape the lives of men,
and we call them norns. There are yet more norns, namely those who come
to every man when he is born, to shape his life, and these are known to
be of the race of gods; others, on the other hand, are of the race of
elves, and yet others are of the race of dwarfs. As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Far asunder, I think,<br>
The norns are born,<br>
They are not of the same race.<br>
Some are of the asas,<br>
Some are of the elves,<br>
Some are daughters of Dvalin.<a class = "tag" name = "tag25" href =
"#note25">25</a>
</p>

<p>Then said Ganglere: If the norns rule the fortunes of men, then they
deal them out exceedingly unevenly. Some live a good life and are rich;
some get neither wealth nor praise. Some have a long, others a short
life. Har answered:
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75"> </a>
Good norns and of good descent shape good lives, and when some men are
weighed down with misfortune, the evil norns are the cause
of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>16. Then said Ganglere: What other remarkable things are there to be
said about the ash? Har answered: Much is to be said about it. On one of
the boughs of the ash sits an eagle, who knows many things. Between his
eyes sits a hawk that is called Vedfolner. A squirrel, by name Ratatosk,
springs up and down the tree, and carries words of envy between the
eagle and Nidhug. Four stags leap about in the branches of the ash and
bite the leaves.<a class = "tag" name = "tag26" href = "#note26">26</a>
Their names are: Dain, Dvalin, Duney and Durathro. In Hvergelmer with
Nidhug are more serpents than tongue can tell. As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
The ash Ygdrasil<br>
Bears distress<br>
Greater than men know.<br>
Stags bite it above,<br>
At the side it rots,<br>
Nidhug gnaws it below.
</p>

<p>And so again it is said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
More serpents lie<br>
’Neath the Ygdrasil ash<br>
Than is thought of<br>
By every foolish ape.<br>
Goin and Moin<br>
(They are sons of Grafvitner),

<a name = "page76"> </a><br>

Ofner and Svafner<br>
Must for aye, methinks,<br>
Gnaw the roots of that tree.<a class = "tag" name = "tag27" href =
"#note27">27</a>
</p>

<p>Again, it is said that the norns, that dwell in the fountain of Urd,
every day take water from the fountain and take the clay that lies
around the fountain and sprinkle therewith the ash, in order that its
branches may not wither or decay. This water is so holy that all things
that are put into the fountain become as white as the film of an
egg-shell As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
An ash I know<br>
Hight Ygdrasil;<br>
A high, holy tree<br>
With white clay sprinkled.<br>
Thence come the dews<br>
That fall in the dales.<br>
Green forever it stands<br>
Over Urd’s fountain.<a class = "tag" name = "tag28" href =
"#note28">28</a>
</p>

<p>The dew which falls on the earth from this tree men call honey-fall,
and it is the food of bees. Two birds are fed in Urd’s fountain; they
are called swans, and they are the parents of the race of swans.</p>

<p>17. Then said Ganglere: Great tidings you are able to tell of the
heavens. Are there other remarkable places than the one by Urd’s
fountain? Answered Har: There are many magnificent
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77"> </a>
dwellings. One is there called Alfheim. There dwell the folk that are
called light-elves; but the dark-elves dwell down in the earth, and they
are unlike the light-elves in appearance, but much more so in deeds. The
light-elves are fairer than the sun to look upon, but the dark-elves are
blacker than pitch. Another place is called Breidablik, and no place is
fairer. There is also a mansion called Glitner, of which the walls and
pillars and posts are of red gold, and the roof is of silver.
Furthermore, there is a dwelling, by name Himinbjorg, which stands at
the end of heaven, where the Bifrost-bridge is united with heaven. And
there is a great dwelling called Valaskjalf, which belongs to Odin. The
gods made it and thatched it with, sheer silver. In this hall is the
high-seat, which is called Hlidskjalf, and when Alfather sits in this
seat, he sees over all the world. In the southern end of the world is
the palace, which is the fairest of all, and brighter than the sun; its
name is Gimle. It shall stand when both heaven and earth shall have
passed away. In this hall the good and the righteous shall dwell through
all ages. Thus says the Prophecy of the Vala:</p>

<p class = "verse">
A hall I know, standing<br>
Than the sun fairer,<br>
Than gold better,<br>
Gimle by name.
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>

There shall good<br>
People dwell,<br>
And forever<br>
Delights enjoy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" href = "#note29">29</a>
</p>

<p>Then said Ganglere: Who guards this palace when Surt’s fire burns up
heaven and earth? Har answered: It is said that to the south and above
this heaven is another heaven, which is called Andlang. But there is a
third, which is above these, and is called Vidblain, and in this heaven
we believe this mansion (Gimle) to be situated; but we deem that the
light-elves alone dwell in it&nbsp;now.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">79</span>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h6>THE ASAS.</h6>

<p>18. Then said Ganglere: Whence comes the wind? It is so strong that
it moves great seas, and fans fires to flame, and yet, strong as it is,
it cannot be seen. Therefore it is wonderfully made. Then answered Har:
That I can tell you well. At the northern end of heaven sits a giant,
who hight Hrasvelg. He is clad in eagles’ plumes, and when he spreads
his wings for flight, the winds arise from under them. Thus is it here
said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hrasvelg hight he<br>
Who sits at the end of heaven,<br>
A giant in eagle’s disguise.<br>
From his wings, they say,<br>
The wind does come<br>
Over all mankind.<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" href = "#note30">30</a>
</p>

<p>19. Then said Ganglere: How comes it that summer is so hot, but the
winter so cold? Har answered: A wise man would not ask such a question,
for all are able to tell this; but if you alone have become so stupid
that you have not heard of it, then I would rather forgive you for
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80"> </a>
asking unwisely once than that you should go any longer in ignorance of
what you ought to know. Svasud is the name of him who is father of
summer, and he lives such a life of enjoyment, that everything that is
mild is from him called sweet (svasligt). But the father of winter has
two names, Vindlone and Vindsval. He is the son of Vasad, and all that
race are grim and of icy breath, and winter is like them.</p>

<p>20. Then asked Ganglere: Which are the asas, in whom men are bound to
believe? Har answered him: Twelve are the divine asas. Jafnhar said: No
less holy are the asynjes (goddesses), nor is their power less. Then
added Thride: Odin is the highest and oldest of the asas. He rules all
things, but the other gods, each according to his might, serve him as
children a father. Frigg is his wife, and she knows the fate of men,
although she tells not thereof, as it is related that Odin himself said
to Asa-Loke:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Mad are you, Loke!<br>
And out of your senses;<br>
Why do you not stop?<br>
Fortunes all,<br>
Methinks, Frigg knows,<br>
Though she tells them not herself.<a class = "tag" name = "tag31" href =
"#note31">31</a>
</p>

<p>Odin is called Alfather, for he is the father of all the gods; he is
also called Valfather, for all
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81"> </a>
who fall in fight are his chosen sons. For them he prepares Valhal and
Vingolf, where they are called einherjes (heroes). He is also called
Hangagod, Haptagod, Farmagod; and he gave himself still more names when
he came to King Geirrod:</p>

<p class = "verse">

</p>

<p>Then said Ganglere: A very great number of names you have given him;
and this I know, forsooth, that he must be a very wise man who is able
to understand and decide what chances are
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82"> </a>
the causes of all these names. Har answered: Much knowledge is needed to
explain it all rightly, but still it is shortest to tell you that most
of these names have been given him for the reason that, as there are
many tongues in the world, so all peoples thought they ought to turn his
name into their tongue, in order that they might be able to worship him
and pray to him each in its own language. Other causes of these names
must be sought in his journeys, which are told of in old sagas; and you
can lay no claim to being called a wise man if you are not able to tell
of these wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>21. Then said Ganglere: What are the names of the other asas? What is
their occupation, and what works have they wrought? Har answered: Thor
is the foremost of them. He is called Asa-Thor, or Oku-Thor.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag33" href = "#note33">33</a> He is the strongest of all
gods and men, and rules over the realm which is called Thrudvang. His
hall is called Bilskirner. Therein are five hundred and forty floors,
and it is the largest house that men have made. Thus it is said in
Grimner’s Lay:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Five hundred floors<br>
And forty more,<br>
Methinks, has bowed Bilskirner.<br>
Of houses all<br>
That I know roofed<br>
I know my son’s is the largest.<a class = "tag" name = "tag34" href =
"#note34">34</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83"> </a>
Thor has two goats, by name Tangnjost and Tangrisner, and a chariot,
wherein he drives. The goats draw the chariot; wherefore he is called
Oku-Thor.<a class = "tag" name = "tag35" href = "#note35">35</a> He
possesses three valuable treasures. One of them is the hammer Mjolner,
which the frost-giants and mountain-giants well know when it is raised;
and this is not to be wondered at, for with it he has split many a skull
of their fathers or friends. The second treasure he possesses is
Megingjarder (belt of strength); when he girds himself with it his
strength is doubled. His third treasure that is of so great value is his
iron gloves; these he cannot do without when he lays hold of the
hammer’s haft. No one is so wise that he can tell all his great works;
but I can tell you so many tidings of him that it will grow late before
all is told that I know.</p>

<p>22. Thereupon said Ganglere: I wish to ask tidings of more of the
asas. Har gave him answer: Odin’s second son is Balder, and of him good
things are to be told. He is the best, and all praise him. He is so fair
of face and so bright that rays of light issue from him; and there is a
plant so white that it is likened unto Balder’s brow, and it is the
whitest of all plants. From this you can judge of the beauty both of his
hair and of his body. He is the wisest, mildest and
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84"> </a>
most eloquent of all the asas; and such is his nature that none can
alter the judgment he has pronounced. He inhabits the place in heaven
called Breidablik, and there nothing unclean can enter. As is here
said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Breidablik it is called,<br>
Where Balder has<br>
Built for himself a hall<br>
In the land<br>
Where I know is found<br>
The least of evil.<a class = "tag" name = "tag36" href =
"#note36">36</a>
</p>

<p>23. The third asa is he who is called Njord. He dwells in Noatun,
which is in heaven. He rules the course of the wind and checks the fury
of the sea and of fire. He is invoked by seafarers and by fishermen. He
is so rich and wealthy that he can give broad lands and abundance to
those who call on him for them. He was fostered in Vanaheim, but the
vans<a class = "tag" name = "tag37" href = "#note37">37</a> gave him as
a hostage to the gods, and received in his stead as an asa-hostage the
god whose name is Honer. He established peace between the gods and vans.
Njord took to wife Skade, a daughter of the giant Thjasse. She wished to
live where her father had dwelt, that is, on the mountains in Thrymheim;
Njord, on the other hand, preferred to be near the sea. They therefore
agreed to pass nine
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85"> </a>
nights in Thrymheim and three in Noatun. But when Njord came back from
the mountains to Noatun he sang this:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Weary am I of the mountains,<br>
Not long was I there,<br>
Only nine nights.<br>
The howl of the wolves<br>
Methought sounded ill<br>
To the song of the swans.
</p>

<p>Skade then sang this:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Sleep I could not<br>
On my sea-strand couch,<br>
For the scream of the sea-fowl.<br>
<i>There</i> wakes me,<br>
As he comes from the sea,<br>
Every morning the mew.
</p>

<p>Then went Skade up on the mountain, and dwelt in Thrymheim. She often
goes on skees (snow-shoes), with her bow, and shoots wild beasts. She is
called skee-goddess or skee-dis. Thus it is said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Thrymheim it is called<br>
Where Thjasse dwelt,<br>
That mightiest giant.<br>
But now dwells Skade,<br>
Pure bride of the gods,<br>
In her father’s old homestead.<a class = "tag" name = "tag38" href =
"#note38">38</a>
</p>

<p>24. Njord, in Noatun, afterward begat two children: a son, by name
Frey, and a daughter, by name Freyja. They were fair of face, and
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86"> </a>
mighty. Frey is the most famous of the asas. He rules over rain and
sunshine, and over the fruits of the earth. It is good to call on him
for harvests and peace. He also sways the wealth of men. Freyja is the
most famous of the goddesses. She has in heaven a dwelling which is
called Folkvang, and when she rides to the battle, one half of the slain
belong to her, and the other half to Odin. As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Folkvang it is called,<br>
And there rules Freyja.<br>
For the seats in the hall<br>
Half of the slain<br>
She chooses each day;<br>
The other half is Odin’s.<a class = "tag" name = "tag39" href =
"#note39">39</a>
</p>

<p>Her hall is Sesrynmer, and it is large and beautiful. When she goes
abroad, she drives in a car drawn by two cats. She lends a favorable ear
to men who call upon her, and it is from her name the title has come
that women of birth and wealth are called frur.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag40" href = "#note40">40</a> She is fond of love ditties, and it is
good to call on her in love affairs.</p>

<p>25. Then said Ganglere: Of great importance these asas seem to me to
be, and it is not wonderful that you have great power, since you have
such excellent knowledge of the gods, and know to which of them to
address your prayers on each
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87"> </a>
occasion. But what other gods are there? Har answered: There is yet an
asa, whose name is Tyr. He is very daring and stout-hearted. He sways
victory in war, wherefore warriors should call on him. There is a saw,
that he who surpasses others in bravery, and never yields, is
Tyr-strong. He is also so wise, that it is said of anyone who is
specially intelligent, that he is Tyr-learned. A proof of his daring is,
that when the asas induced the wolf Fenrer to let himself be bound with
the chain Gleipner, he would not believe that they would loose him again
until Tyr put his hand in his mouth as a pledge. But when the asas would
not loose the Fenris-wolf, he bit Tyr’s hand off at the place of the
wolf’s joint (the wrist; Icel. <i>úlfliðr</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag41" href = "#note41">41</a>). From that time Tyr is one-handed, and
he is now called a peacemaker among&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>26. Brage is the name of another of the asas. He is famous for his
wisdom, eloquence and flowing speech. He is a master-skald, and from him
song-craft is called brag (poetry), and such men or women as distinguish
themselves by their eloquence are called brag-men<a class = "tag" name =
"tag42" href = "#note42">42</a> and brag-women. His wife is Idun. She
keeps in a box those
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88"> </a>
apples of which the gods eat when they grow old, and then they become
young again, and so it will be until Ragnarok (the twilight of the
gods). Then said Ganglere: Of great importance to the gods it must be,
it seems to me, that Idun preserves these apples with care and honesty.
Har answered, and laughed: They ran a great risk on one occasion,
whereof I might tell you more, but you shall first hear the names of
more asas.</p>

<p>27. Heimdal is the name of one. He is also called the white-asa. He
is great and holy; born of nine maidens, all of whom were sisters. He
hight also Hallinskide and Gullintanne, for his teeth were of gold. His
horse hight Gulltop (Gold-top). He dwells in a place called Himinbjorg,
near Bifrost. He is the ward of the gods, and sits at the end of heaven,
guarding the bridge against the mountain-giants. He needs less sleep
than a bird; sees an hundred miles around him, and as well by night as
by day. He hears the grass grow and the wool on the backs of the sheep,
and of course all things that sound louder than these. He has a trumpet
called the Gjallarhorn, and when he blows it it can be heard in all the
worlds. The head is called Heimdal’s sword. Thus it is here said:</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89"> </a></p>
<p class = "verse">
Himinbjorg it is called,<br>
Where Heimdal rules<br>
Over his holy halls;<br>
There drinks the ward of the gods<br>
In his delightful dwelling<br>
Glad the good mead.<a class = "tag" name = "tag43" href =
"#note43">43</a>
</p>

<p>And again, in Heimdal’s Song, he says himself:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Son I am of maidens nine,<br>
Born I am of sisters nine.
</p>

<p>28. Hoder hight one of the asas, who is blind, but exceedingly
strong; and the gods would wish that this asa never needed to be named,
for the work of his hand will long be kept in memory both by gods
and&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>29. Vidar is the name of the silent asa. He has a very thick shoe,
and he is the strongest next after Thor. From him the gods have much
help in all hard tasks.</p>

<p>30. Ale, or Vale, is the son of Odin and Rind. He is daring in
combat, and a good shot.</p>

<p>31. Uller is the name of one, who is a son of Sif, and a step-son of
Thor. He is so good an archer, and so fast on his skees, that no one can
contend with him. He is fair of face, and possesses every quality of a
warrior. Men should invoke him in single combat.</p>

<p>32. Forsete is a son of Balder and Nanna, Nep’s daughter. He has in
heaven the hall which hight
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90"> </a>
Glitner. All who come to him with disputes go away perfectly reconciled.
No better tribunal is to be found among gods and men. Thus it is here
said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Glitner hight the hall,<br>
On gold pillars standing,<br>
And roofed with silver.<br>
There dwells Forsete<br>
Throughout all time,<br>
And settles all disputes.<a class = "tag" name = "tag44" href =

<h6>LOKE AND HIS OFFSPRING.</h6>

<p>33. There is yet one who is numbered among the asas, but whom some
call the backbiter of the asas. He is the originator of deceit, and the
disgrace of all gods and men. His name is Loke, or Lopt. His father is
the giant Farbaute, but his mother’s name is Laufey, or Nal. His
brothers are Byleist and Helblinde. Loke is fair and beautiful of face,
but evil in disposition, and very fickle-minded. He surpasses other men
in the craft called cunning, and cheats in all things. He has often
brought the asas into great trouble, and often helped them out again,
with his cunning contrivances. His wife hight Sygin, and their son,
Nare, or Narfe.</p>

<p>34. Loke had yet more children. A giantess in Jotunheim, hight
Angerboda. With her he begat three children. The first was the
Fenris-wolf; the second, Jormungand, that is, the Midgard-serpent, and
the third, Hel. When the gods knew that these three children were being
fostered in Jotunheim, and were aware of the prophecies that much woe
and misfortune would thence come to
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92"> </a>
them, and considering that much evil might be looked for from them on
their mother’s side, and still more on their father’s, Alfather sent
some of the gods to take the children and bring them to him. When they
came to him he threw the serpent into the deep sea which surrounds all
lands. There waxed the serpent so that he lies in the midst of the
ocean, surrounds all the earth, and bites his own tail. Hel he cast into
Niflheim, and gave her power over nine worlds,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag45" href = "#note45">45</a> that she should appoint abodes to them
that are sent to her, namely, those who die from sickness or old age.
She has there a great mansion, and the walls around it are of strange
height, and the gates are huge. Eljudner is the name of her hall. Her
table hight famine; her knife, starvation. Her man-servant’s name is
Ganglate; her maid-servant’s, Ganglot.<a class = "tag" name = "tag46"
href = "#note46">46</a> Her threshold is called stumbling-block; her
bed, care; the precious hangings of her bed, gleaming bale. One-half of
her is blue, and the other half is of the hue of flesh; hence she is
easily known. Her looks are very stern and grim.</p>

<p>35. The wolf was fostered by the asas at home, and Tyr was the only
one who had the courage to go to him and give him food. When the gods
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93"> </a>
saw how much he grew every day, and all prophecies declared that he was
predestined to become fatal to them, they resolved to make a very strong
fetter, which they called Lading. They brought it to the wolf, and bade
him try his strength on the fetter. The wolf, who did not think it would
be too strong for him, let them do therewith as they pleased. But as
soon as he spurned against it the fetter burst asunder, and he was free
from Lading. Then the asas made another fetter, by one-half stronger,
and this they called Drome. They wanted the wolf to try this also,
saying to him that he would become very famous for his strength, if so
strong a chain was not able to hold him. The wolf thought that this
fetter was indeed very strong, but also that his strength had increased
since he broke Lading. He also took into consideration that it was
necessary to expose one’s self to some danger if he desired to become
famous; so he let them put the fetter on him. When the asas said they
were ready, the wolf shook himself, spurned against and dashed the
fetter on the ground, so that the broken pieces flew a long distance.
Thus he broke loose out of Drome. Since then it has been held as a
proverb, “to get loose out of Lading” or “to dash out of Drome,”
whenever anything is extraordinarily hard. The asas now began to fear
that they would not get the wolf bound.
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94"> </a>
So Alfather sent the youth, who is called Skirner, and is Frey’s
messenger, to some dwarfs in Svartalfaheim, and had them make the fetter
which is called Gleipner. It was made of six things: of the footfall of
cats, of the beard of woman, of the roots of the mountain, of the sinews
of the bear, of the breath of the fish, and of the spittle of the birds.
If you have not known this before, you can easily find out that it is
true and that there is no lie about it, since you must have observed
that a woman has no beard, that a cat’s footfall cannot be heard, and
that mountains have no roots; and I know, forsooth, that what I have
told you is perfectly true, although there are some things that you do
not understand. Then said Ganglere: This I must surely understand to be
true. I can see these things which you have taken as proof. But how was
the fetter smithied? Answered Har: That I can well explain to you. It
was smooth and soft as a silken string. How strong and trusty it was you
shall now hear. When the fetter was brought to the asas, they thanked
the messenger for doing his errand so well. Then they went out into the
lake called Amsvartner, to the holm (rocky island) called Lyngve, and
called the wolf to go with them. They showed him the silken band and
bade him break it, saying that it was somewhat stronger than its
thinness would lead one to suppose.
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95"> </a>
Then they handed it from one to the other and tried its strength with
their hands, but it did not break. Still they said the wolf would be
able to snap it. The wolf answered: It seems to me that I will get no
fame though I break asunder so slender a thread as this is. But if it is
made with craft and guile, then, little though it may look, that band
will never come on my feet. Then said the asas that he would easily be
able to break a slim silken band, since he had already burst large iron
fetters asunder. But even if you are unable to break this band, you have
nothing to fear from the gods, for we will immediately loose you again.
The wolf answered: If you get me bound so fast that I am not able to
loose myself again, you will skulk away, and it will be long before I
get any help from you, wherefore I am loth to let this band be laid on
me; but in order that you may not accuse me of cowardice, let some one
of you lay his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done without
deceit. The one asa looked at the other, and thought there now was a
choice of two evils, and no one would offer his hand, before Tyr held
out his right hand and laid it in the wolf’s mouth. But when the wolf
now began to spurn against it the band grew stiffer, and the more he
strained the tighter it got. They all laughed except Tyr; he lost his
hand. When the asas saw that the
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96"> </a>
wolf was sufficiently well bound, they took the chain which was fixed to
the fetter, and which was called Gelgja, and drew it through a large
rock which is called Gjol, and fastened this rock deep down in the
earth. Then they took a large stone, which is called Tvite, and drove it
still deeper into the ground, and used this stone for a fastening-pin.
The wolf opened his mouth terribly wide, raged and twisted himself with
all his might, and wanted to bite them; but they put a sword in his
mouth, in such a manner that the hilt stood in his lower jaw and the
point in the upper, that is his gag. He howls terribly, and the saliva
which runs from his mouth forms a river called Von. There he will lie
until Ragnarok. Then said Ganglere: Very bad are these children of Loke,
but they are strong and mighty. But why did not the asas kill the wolf
when they have evil to expect from him? Har answered: So great respect
have the gods for their holiness and peace-stead, that they would not
stain them with the blood of the wolf, though prophecies foretell that
he must become the bane of Odin.</p>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h6>THE GODDESSES (ASYNJES).</h6>

<p>36. Ganglere asked: Which are the goddesses? Har answered: Frigg is
the first; she possesses the right lordly dwelling which is called
Fensaler. The second is Saga, who dwells in Sokvabek, and this is a
large dwelling. The third is Eir, who is the best leech. The fourth is
Gefjun, who is a may, and those who die maids become her hand-maidens.
The fifth is Fulla, who is also a may, she wears her hair flowing and
has a golden ribbon about her head; she carries Frigg’s chest, takes
care of her shoes and knows her secrets. The sixth is Freyja, who is
ranked with Frigg. She is wedded to the man whose name is Oder; their
daughter’s name is Hnos, and she is so fair that all things fair and
precious are called, from her name, Hnos. Oder went far away. Freyja
weeps for him, but her tears are red gold. Freyja has many names, and
the reason therefor is that she changed her name among the various
nations to which she came in search of Oder. She is called Mardol, Horn,
Gefn, and Syr. She has the necklace Brising, and she is called Vanadis.
The
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98"> </a>
seventh is Sjofn, who is fond of turning men’s and women’s hearts to
love, and it is from her name that love is called Sjafne. The eighth is
Lofn, who is kind and good to those who call upon her, and she has
permission from Alfather or Frigg to bring together men and women, no
matter what difficulties may stand in the way; therefore “love” is so
called from her name, and also that which is much loved by men. The
ninth is Var. She hears the oaths and troths that men and women plight
to each other. Hence such vows are called vars, and she takes vengeance
on those who break their promises. The tenth is Vor, who is so wise and
searching that nothing can be concealed from her. It is a saying that a
woman becomes vor (ware) of what she becomes wise. The eleventh is Syn,
who guards the door of the hall, and closes it against those who are not
to enter. In trials she guards those suits in which anyone tries to make
use of falsehood. Hence is the saying that “syn is set against it,” when
anyone tries to deny ought. The twelfth is Hlin, who guards those men
whom Frigg wants to protect from any danger. Hence is the saying that he
hlins who is forewarned. The thirteenth is Snotra, who is wise and
courtly. After her, men and women who are wise are called Snotras. The
fourteenth is Gna, whom Frigg sends on her errands into various worlds.
She rides upon a
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99"> </a>
horse called Hofvarpner, that runs through the air and over the sea.
Once, when she was riding, some vans saw her faring through the air.
Then said one of them:</p>

<p class = "verse">
What flies there?<br>
What fares there?<br>
What glides in the air?
</p>

<p>She answered</p>

<p class = "verse">
I fly not,<br>
Though I fare<br>
And glide through the air<br>
On Hofvarpner,<br>
That Hamskerper,<br>
Begat with Gardrofa.<a class = "tag" name = "tag47" href =
"#note47">47</a>
</p>

<p>From Gna’s name it is said that anything that fares high in the air
gnas. Sol and Bil are numbered among the goddesses, but their nature has
already been described.<a class = "tag" name = "tag48" href =
"#note48">48</a></p>

<p>37. There are still others who are to serve in Valhal, bear the drink
around, wait upon the table and pass the ale-horns. Thus they are named
in Grimner’s Lay:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hrist and Mist<br>
I want my horn to bring to me;<br>
Skeggold and Skogul,<br>
Hild and Thrud,<br>

</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100"> </a>
These are called valkyries. Odin sends them to all battles, where they
choose those who are to be slain, and rule over the victory. Gud and
Rosta, and the youngest norn, Skuld, always ride to sway the battle and
choose the slain. Jord, the mother of Thor, and Rind, Vale’s mother, are
numbered among the goddesses.</p>

<h6>THE GIANTESS GERD AND SKIRNER’S JOURNEY.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag50" href = "#note50">50</a></h6>

<p>38. Gymer hight a man whose wife was Orboda, of the race of the
mountain giants. Their daughter was Gerd, the fairest of all women. One
day when Frey had gone into Hlidskjalf, and was looking out upon all the
worlds, he saw toward the north a hamlet wherein was a large and
beautiful house. To this house went a woman, and when she raised her
hands to open the door, both the sky and the sea glistened therefrom,
and she made all the world bright. As a punishment for his audacity in
seating himself in that holy seat, Frey went away full of grief. When he
came home, he neither spake, slept, nor drank, and no one dared speak to
him. Then Njord sent for Skirner, Frey’s servant, bade him go to Frey
and ask him with whom he was so angry, since he would speak to nobody.
Skirner said that he would go, though he was loth to do so, as it was
probable that he would get evil words in reply. When he came to Frey and
asked him why he was so sad that he would not
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102"> </a>
talk, Frey answered that he had seen a beautiful woman, and for her sake
he had become so filled with grief, that he could not live any longer if
he could not get her. And now you must go, he added, and ask her hand
for me and bring her home to me, whether it be with or without the
consent of her father. I will reward you well for your trouble. Skirner
answered saying that he would go on this errand, but Frey must give him
his sword, that was so excellent that it wielded itself in fight. Frey
made no objection to this and gave him the sword. Skirner went on his
journey, courted Gerd for him, and got the promise of her that she nine
nights thereafter should come to Bar-Isle and there have her wedding
with Frey. When Skirner came back and gave an account of his journey,
Frey said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Long is one night,<br>
Long are two nights,<br>
How can I hold out three?<br>
Oft to me one month<br>
Seemed less<br>
Than this half night of love.<a class = "tag" name = "tag51" href =
"#note51">51</a>
</p>

<p>This is the reason why Frey was unarmed when he fought with Bele, and
slew him with a hart’s horn. Then said Ganglere: It is a great wonder
that such a lord as Frey would give away his sword, when he did not have
another as good.
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103"> </a>
A great loss it was to him when he fought with Bele; and this I know,
forsooth, that he must have repented of that gift. Har answered: Of no
great account was his meeting with Bele. Frey could have slain him with
his hand. But the time will come when he will find himself in a worse
plight for not having his sword, and that will be when the sons of
Muspel sally forth to the fight.</p>

<h6>LIFE IN VALHAL.</h6>

<p>39. Then said Ganglere: You say that all men who since the beginning
of the world have fallen in battle have come to Odin in Valhal. What
does he have to give them to eat? It seems to me there must be a great
throng of people. Har answered: It is true, as you remark, that there is
a great throng; many more are yet to come there, and still they will be
thought too few when the wolf<a class = "tag" name = "tag52" href =
"#note52">52</a> comes. But however great may be the throng in Valhal,
they will get plenty of flesh of the boar Sahrimner. He is boiled every
day and is whole again in the evening. But as to the question you just
asked, it seems to me there are but few men so wise that they are able
to answer it correctly. The cook’s name is Andhrimner, and the kettle is
called Eldhrimner as is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Andhrimner cooks<br>

’Tis the best of flesh.<br>
There are few who know<br>
What the einherjes eat.<a class = "tag" name = "tag53" href =
"#note53">53</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105"> </a>
Ganglere asked: Does Odin have the same kind of food as the einherjes?
Har answered: The food that is placed on his table he gives to his two
wolves, which hight Gere and Freke. He needs no food himself. Wine is to
him both food and drink, as is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Gere and Freke<br>
Sates the warfaring,<br>
Famous father of hosts;<br>
But on wine alone<br>
Odin in arms renowned<br>
Forever lives.<a class = "tag" name = "tag54" href = "#note54">54</a>
</p>

<p>Two ravens sit on Odin’s shoulders, and bring to his ears all that
they hear and see. Their names are Hugin and Munin. At dawn he sends
them out to fly over the whole world, and they come back at breakfast
time. Thus he gets information about many things, and hence he is called
Rafnagud (raven-god). As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hugin and Munin<br>
Fly every day<br>
Over the great earth.<br>
I fear for Hugin<br>
That he may not return,<br>
Yet more am I anxious for Munin.<a class = "tag" name = "tag55" href =
"#note55">55</a>
</p>

<p>40. Then asked Ganglere: What do the einherjes have to drink that is
furnished them as bountifully as the food? Or do they drink water? Har
answered: That is a wonderful question.
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106"> </a>
Do you suppose that Alfather invites kings, jarls, or other great men,
and gives them water to drink? This I know, forsooth, that many a one
comes to Valhal who would think he was paying a big price for his
water-drink, if there were no better reception to be found
there,&mdash;persons, namely, who have died from wounds and pain. But I
can tell you other tidings. A she-goat, by name Heidrun, stands up in
Valhal and bites the leaves off the branches of that famous tree called
Lerad. From her teats runs so much mead that she fills every day a
vessel in the hall from which the horns are filled, and which is so
large that all the einherjes get all the drink they want out of it. Then
said Ganglere: That is a most useful goat, and a right excellent tree
that must be that she feeds upon. Then said Har: Still more remarkable
is the hart Eikthyrner, which stands over Valhal and bites the branches
of the same tree. From his horns fall so many drops down into
Hvergelmer, that thence flow the rivers that are called Sid, Vid, Sekin,
Ekin, Svol, Gunthro, Fjorm, Fimbulthul, Gipul, Gopul, Gomul and
Geirvimul, all of which fall about the abodes of the asas. The following
are also named: Thyn, Vin, Thol, Bol, Grad, Gunthrain, Nyt, Not, Non,
Hron, Vina, Vegsvin, Thjodnuma.</p>

<p>41. Then said Ganglere: That was a wonderful tiding that you now told
me. A mighty
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107"> </a>
house must Valhal be, and a great crowd there must often be at the door.
Then answered Har: Why do you not ask how many doors there are in
Valhal, and how large they are? When you find that out, you will confess
that it would rather be wonderful if everybody could not easily go in
and out. It is also a fact that it is no more difficult to find room
within than to get in. Of this you may hear what the Lay of Grimner
says:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Five hundred doors<br>
And forty more,<br>
I trow, there are in Valhal.<br>
Eight hundred einherjes<br>
Go at a time through one door<br>
When they fare to fight with the wolf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag56"
href = "#note56">56</a>
</p>

<p>42. Then said Ganglere: A mighty band of men there is in Valhal, and,
forsooth, I know that Odin is a very great chief, since he commands so
mighty a host. But what is the pastime of the einherjes when they do not
drink? Har answered: Every morning, when they have dressed themselves,
they take their weapons and go out into the court and fight and slay
each other. That is their play. Toward breakfast-time they ride home to
Valhal and sit down to drink. As is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
All the einherjes<br>
In Odin’s court<br>
Hew daily each other.
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108"> </a><br>
They choose the slain<br>
And ride from the battle-field,<br>
Then sit they in peace together.<a class = "tag" name = "tag57" href =
"#note57">57</a>
</p>

<p>But true it is, as you said, that Odin is a great chief. There are
many proofs of that. Thus it is said in the very words of the asas
themselves:</p>

<p class = "verse">
The Ygdrasil ash<br>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "gylfe_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>

<h6>ODIN’S HORSE AND FREY’S SHIP.</h6>

<p>43. Ganglere asked: Whose is that horse Sleipner, and what is there
to say about it? Har answered: You have no knowledge of Sleipner, nor do
you know the circumstances attending his birth; but it must seem to you
worth the telling. In the beginning, when the town of the gods was
building, when the gods had established Midgard and made Valhal, there
came a certain builder and offered to make them a burg, in three half
years, so excellent that it should be perfectly safe against the
mountain-giants and frost-giants, even though they should get within
Midgard. But he demanded as his reward, that he should have Freyja, and
he wanted the sun and moon besides. Then the asas came together and held
counsel, and the bargain was made with the builder that he should get
what he demanded if he could get the burg done in one winter; but if on
the first day of summer any part of the burg was unfinished, then the
contract should be void. It was also agreed that no man should help him
with the work. When they told him these terms, he requested
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110"> </a>
that they should allow him to have the help of his horse, called
Svadilfare, and at the suggestion of Loke this was granted&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>On the first day of winter he began to build the burg, but by night
he hauled stone for it with his horse. But it seemed a great wonder to
the asas what great rocks that horse drew, and the horse did one half
more of the mighty task than the builder. The bargain was firmly
established with witnesses and oaths, for the giant did not deem it safe
to be among the asas without truce if Thor should come home, who now was
on a journey to the east fighting trolls. Toward the end of winter the
burg was far built, and it was so high and strong that it could in
nowise be taken. When there were three days left before summer, the work
was all completed excepting the burg gate. Then went the gods to their
judgment-seats and held counsel, and asked each other who could have
advised to give Freyja in marriage in Jotunheim, or to plunge the air
and the heavens in darkness by taking away the sun and the moon and
giving them to the giant; and all agreed that this must have been
advised by him who gives the most bad counsels, namely, Loke, son of
Laufey, and they threatened him with a cruel death if he could not
contrive some way of preventing the builder from fulfilling his part of
the bargain, and they proceeded
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111"> </a>
to lay hands on Loke. He in his fright then promised with an oath that
he should so manage that the builder should lose his wages, let it cost
him what it would. And the same evening, when the builder drove out
after stone with his horse Svadilfare, a mare suddenly ran out of the
woods to the horse and began to neigh at him. The steed, knowing what
sort of horse this was, grew excited, burst the reins asunder and ran
after the mare, but she ran from him into the woods. The builder hurried
after them with all his might, and wanted to catch the steed, but these
horses kept running all night, and thus the time was lost, and at dawn
the work had not made the usual progress. When the builder saw that his
work was not going to be completed, he resumed his giant form. When the
asas thus became sure that it was really a mountain-giant that had come
among them, they did not heed their oaths, but called on Thor. He came
straightway, swung his hammer, Mjolner, and paid the workman his
wages,&mdash;not with the sun and moon, but rather by preventing him
from dwelling in Jotunheim; and this was easily done with the first blow
of the hammer, which broke his skull into small pieces and sent him down
to Niflhel. But Loke had run such a race with Svadilfare that he some
time after bore a foal. It was gray, and had eight feet, and this is the
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112"> </a>
best horse among gods and men. Thus it is said in the Vala’s
Prophecy:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Then went the gods.<br>
The most holy gods,<br>
Onto their judgment-seats,<br>
And counseled together<br>
Who all the air<br>
With guile had blended<br>
Or to the giant race<br>
Oder’s may had given.<br>
Broken were oaths,<br>
And words and promises,&mdash;<br>
All mighty speech<br>
That had passed between them.<br>
Thor alone did this,<br>
Swollen with anger.<br>
Seldom sits he still<br>
When such things he hears.<a class = "tag" name = "tag59" href =
"#note59">59</a>
</p>

<p>44. Then asked Ganglere: What is there to be said of Skidbladner,
which you say is the best of ships? Is there no ship equally good, or
equally great? Made answer Har: Skidbladner is the best of ships, and is
made with the finest workmanship; but Naglfare, which is in Muspel, is
the largest. Some dwarfs, the sons of Ivalde, made Skidbladner and gave
it to Frey. It is so large that all the asas, with their weapons and
war-gear, can find room on board it, and as soon as the sails are
hoisted it has fair wind, no matter whither it is going. When it is not
wanted for a voyage, it is made of so many pieces and with so much
skill, that Frey can fold it together like a napkin and carry it in his
pocket.</p>

<h6>THOR’S ADVENTURES.</h6>

<p>Then said Ganglere: A good ship is Skidbladner, but much black art
must have been resorted to ere it was so fashioned. Has Thor never come
where he has found anything so strong and mighty that it has been
superior to him either in strength or in the black art? Har answered:
Few men, I know, are able to tell thereof, but still he has often been
in difficult straits. But though there have been things so mighty and
strong that Thor has not been able to gain the victory, they are such as
ought not to be spoken of; for there are many proofs which all must
accept that Thor is the mightiest. Then said Ganglere: It seems to me
that I have now asked about something that no one can answer. Said
Jafnhar: We have heard tell of adventures that seem to us incredible,
but here sits one near who is able to tell true tidings thereof, and you
may believe that he will not lie for the first time now, who never told
a lie before. Then said Ganglere: I will stand here and listen, to see
if any answer is to be had to this question. But if you cannot
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114"> </a>
answer my question I declare you to be defeated. Then answered Thride:
It is evident that he now is bound to know, though it does not seem
proper for us to speak thereof. The beginning of this adventure is that
Oku-Thor went on a journey with his goats and chariot, and with him went
the asa who is called Loke. In the evening they came to a bonde<a class
= "tag" name = "tag60" href = "#note60">60</a> and got there lodgings
for the night. In the evening Thor took his goats and killed them both,
whereupon he had them flayed and borne into a kettle. When the flesh was
boiled, Thor and his companion sat down to supper. Thor invited the
bonde, his wife and their children, a son by name Thjalfe, and a
daughter by name Roskva, to eat with them. Then Thor laid the goat-skins
away from the fire-place, and requested the bonde and his household to
cast the bones onto the skins. Thjalfe, the bonde’s son, had the thigh
of one of the goats, which he broke asunder with his knife, in order to
get at the marrow, Thor remained there over night. In the morning, just
before daybreak, he arose, dressed himself, took the hammer Mjolner,
lifted it and hallowed the goat-skins. Then the goats arose, but one of
them limped on one of its hind legs. When Thor saw this he said that
either the bonde or one of his folk had not dealt skillfully with the
goat’s bones, for he noticed that
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115"> </a>
the thigh was broken. It is not necessary to dwell on this part of the
story. All can understand how frightened the bonde became when he saw
that Thor let his brows sink down over his eyes. When he saw his eyes he
thought he must fall down at the sight of them alone. Thor took hold of
the handle of his hammer so hard that his knuckles grew white. As might
be expected, the bonde and all his household cried aloud and sued for
peace, offering him as an atonement all that they possessed. When he saw
their fear, his wrath left him. He was appeased, and took as a ransom
the bonders children, Thjalfe and Roskva. They became his servants, and
have always accompanied him since that time.</p>

<p>46. He left his goats there and went on his way east into Jotunheim,
clear to the sea, and then he went on across the deep ocean, and went
ashore on the other side, together with Loke and Thjalfe and Roskva.
When they had proceeded a short distance, there stood before them a
great wood, through which they kept going the whole day until dark.
Thjalfe, who was of all men the fleetest of foot, bore Thor’s bag, but
the wood was no good place for provisions. When it had become dark, they
sought a place for their night lodging, and found a very large hall. At
the end of it was a door as wide as the
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116"> </a>
hall. Here they remained through the night. About midnight there was a
great earthquake; the ground trembled beneath them, and the house shook.
Then Thor stood up and called his companions. They looked about them and
found an adjoining room to the right, in the midst of the hall, and
there they went in. Thor seated himself in the door; the others went
farther in and were very much frightened. Thor held his hammer by the
handle, ready to defend himself. Then they heard a great groaning and
roaring. When it began to dawn, Thor went out and saw a man lying not
far from him in the wood. He was very large, lay sleeping, and snored
loudly. Then Thor thought he had found out what noise it was that they
had heard in the night. He girded himself with his Megingjarder, whereby
his asa-might increased. Meanwhile the man woke, and immediately arose.
It is said that Thor this once forbore to strike him with the hammer,
and asked him for his name. He called himself Skrymer; but, said he, I
do not need to ask you what your name is,&mdash;I know that you are
Asa-Thor. But what have you done with my glove? He stretched out his
hand and picked up his glove. Then Thor saw that the glove was the hall
in which he had spent the night, and that the adjoining room was the
thumb of the glove. Skrymer asked whether
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117"> </a>
they would accept of his company. Thor said yes. Skrymer took and loosed
his provision-sack and began to eat his breakfast; but Thor and his
fellows did the same in another place. Skrymer proposed that they should
lay their store of provisions together, to which Thor consented. Then
Skrymer bound all their provisions into one bag, laid it on his back,
and led the way all the day, taking gigantic strides. Late in the
evening he sought out a place for their night quarters under a large
oak. Then Skrymer said to Thor that he wanted to lie down to sleep; they
might take the provision-sack and make ready their supper. Then Skrymer
fell asleep and snored tremendously. When Thor took the provision-sack
and was to open it, then happened what seems incredible, but still it
must be told,&mdash;that he could not get one knot loosened, nor could
he stir a single end of the strings so that it was looser than before.
When he saw that all his efforts were in vain he became wroth, seized
his hammer Mjolner with both his hands, stepped with one foot forward to
where Skrymer was lying and dashed the hammer at his head. Skrymer awoke
and asked whether some leaf had fallen upon his head; whether they had
taken their supper, and were ready to go to sleep. Thor answered that
they were just going to sleep. Then they went under another oak. But the
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118"> </a>
truth must be told, that there was no fearless sleeping. About midnight
Thor heard that Skrymer was snoring and sleeping so fast that it
thundered in the wood. He arose and went over to him, clutched the
hammer tight and hard, and gave him a blow in the middle of the crown,
so that he knew that the head of the hammer sank deep into his head. But
just then Skrymer awoke and asked: What is that? Did an acorn fall onto
my head? How is it with you, Thor? Thor hastened back, answered that he
had just waked up, and said that it was midnight and still time to
sleep. Then Thor made up his mind that if he could get a chance to give
him the third blow, he should never see him again, and he now lay
watching for Skrymer to sleep fast. Shortly before daybreak he heard
that Skrymer had fallen asleep. So he arose and ran over to him. He
clutched the hammer with all his might and dashed it at his temples,
which he saw uppermost. The hammer sank up to the handle. Skrymer sat
up, stroked his temples, and said: Are there any birds sitting in the
tree above me? Methought, as I awoke, that some moss from the branches
fell on my head. What! are you awake, Thor? It is now time to get up and
dress; but you have not far left to the burg that is called Utgard. I
have heard that you have been whispering among yourselves that I
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119"> </a>
am not small of stature, but you will see greater men when you come to
Utgard. Now I will give you wholesome advice. Do not brag too much of
yourselves, for Utgard-Loke’s thanes will not brook the boasting of such
insignificant little fellows as you are; otherwise turn back, and that
is, in fact, the best thing for you to do. But if you are bound to
continue your journey, then keep straight on eastward; my way lies to
the north, to those mountains that you there see. Skrymer then took the
provision-sack and threw it on his back, and, leaving them, turned into
the wood, and it has not been learned whether the asas wished to meet
him again in health.</p>

<p>47. Thor and his companions went their way and continued their
journey until noon. Then they saw a burg standing on a plain, and it was
so high that they had to bend their necks clear back before they could
look over it. They drew nearer and came to the burg-gate, which was
closed. Thor finding himself unable to open it, and being anxious to get
within the burg, they crept between the bars and so came in. They
discovered a large hall and went to it. Finding the door open they
entered, and saw there many men, the most of whom were immensely large,
sitting on two benches. Thereupon they approached the king, Utgard-Loke,
and greeted him. He scarcely deigned to look at them, smiled scornfully
and
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120"> </a>
showed his teeth, saying: It is late to ask for tidings of a long
journey, but if I am not mistaken this stripling is Oku-Thor, is it not?
It may be, however, that you are really bigger than you look For what
feats are you and your companions prepared? No one can stay with us
here, unless he is skilled in some craft or accomplishment beyond the
most of men. Then answered he who came in last, namely Loke: I know the
feat of which I am prepared to give proof, that there is no one present
who can eat his food faster than I. Then said Utgard-Loke: That is a
feat, indeed, if you can keep your word, and you shall try it
immediately. He then summoned from the bench a man by name Loge, and
requested him to come out on the floor and try his strength against
Loke. They took a trough full of meat and set it on the floor, whereupon
Loke seated himself at one end and Loge at the other. Both ate as fast
as they could, and met at the middle of the trough. Loke had eaten all
the flesh off from the bones, but Loge had consumed both the flesh and
the bones, and the trough too. All agreed that Loke had lost the wager.
Then Utgard-Loke asked what game that young man knew? Thjalfe answered
that he would try to run a race with anyone that Utgard-Loke might
designate. Utgard-Loke said this was a good feat, and added that it was
to be
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121"> </a>
hoped that he excelled in swiftness if he expected to win in this game,
but he would soon have the matter decided. He arose and went out. There
was an excellent race-course along the flat plain. Utgard-Loke then
summoned a young man, whose name was Huge, and bade him run a race with
Thjalfe. Then they took the first heat, and Huge was so much ahead that
when he turned at the goal he met Thjalfe. Said Utgard-Loke: You must
lay yourself more forward, Thjalfe, if you want to win the race; but
this I confess, that there has never before come anyone hither who was
swifter of foot than you. Then they took a second heat, and when Huge
came to the goal and turned, there was a long bolt-shot to Thjalfe. Then
said Utgard-Loke: Thjalfe seems to me to run well; still I scarcely
think he will win the race, but this will be proven when they run the
third heat. Then they took one more heat. Huge ran to the goal and
turned back, but Thjalfe had not yet gotten to the middle of the course.
Then all said that this game had been tried sufficiently. Utgard-Loke
now asked Thor what feats there were that he would be willing to exhibit
before them, corresponding to the tales that men tell of his great
works. Thor replied that he preferred to compete with someone in
drinking. Utgard-Loke said there would be no objection to this. He went
into the hall,
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122"> </a>
called his cup-bearer, and requested him to take the sconce-horn that
his thanes were wont to drink from. The cup-bearer immediately brought
forward the horn and handed it to Thor. Said Utgard-Loke: From this horn
it is thought to be well drunk if it is emptied in one draught, some men
empty it in two draughts, but there is no drinker so wretched that he
cannot exhaust it in three. Thor looked at the horn and did not think it
was very large, though it seemed pretty long, but he was very thirsty.
He put it to his lips and swallowed with all his might, thinking that he
should not have to bend over the horn a second time. But when his breath
gave out, and he looked into the horn to see how it had gone with his
drinking, it seemed to him difficult to determine whether there was less
in it than before. Then said Utgard-Loke: That is well drunk, still it
is not very much. I could never have believed it, if anyone had told me,
that Asa-Thor could not drink more, but I know you will be able to empty
it in a second draught. Thor did not answer, but set the horn to his
lips, thinking that he would now take a larger draught. He drank as long
as he could and drank deep, as he was wont, but still he could not make
the tip of the horn come up as much as he would like. And when he set
the horn away and looked into it, it seemed to him that he had drunk
less than
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123"> </a>
the first time; but the horn could now be borne without spilling. Then
said Utgard-Loke: How now, Thor! Are you not leaving more for the third
draught than befits your skill? It seems to me that if you are to empty
the horn with the third draught, then this will be the greatest. You
will not be deemed so great a man here among us as the asas call you, if
you do not distinguish yourself more in other feats than you seem to me
to have done in this. Then Thor became wroth, set the horn to his mouth
and drank with all his might and kept on as long as he could, and when
he looked into it its contents had indeed visibly diminished, but he
gave back the horn and would not drink any more. Said Utgard-Loke: It is
clear that your might is not so great as we thought. Would you like to
try other games? It is evident that you gained nothing by the first.
Answered Thor: I should like to try other games, but I should be
surprised if such a drink at home among the asas would be called small.
What game will you now offer me? Answered Utgard-Loke: Young lads here
think it nothing but play to lift my cat up from the ground, and I
should never have dared to offer such a thing to Asa-Thor had I not
already seen that you are much less of a man than I thought. Then there
sprang forth on the floor a gray cat, and it was rather large. Thor went
over to it,
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124"> </a>
put his hand under the middle of its body and tried to lift it up, but
the cat bent its back in the same degree as Thor raised his hands; and
when he had stretched them up as far as he was able the cat lifted one
foot, and Thor did not carry the game any further. Then said
Utgard-Loke: This game ended as I expected. The cat is rather large, and
Thor is small, and little compared with the great men that are here with
us. Said Thor: Little as you call me, let anyone who likes come hither
and wrestle with me, for now I am wroth. Answered Utgard-Loke, looking
about him on the benches: I do not see anyone here who would not think
it a trifle to wrestle with you. And again he said: Let me see first!
Call hither that old woman, Elle, my foster-mother, and let Thor wrestle
with her if he wants to. She has thrown to the ground men who have
seemed to me no less strong than Thor. Then there came into the hall an
old woman. Utgard-Loke bade her take a wrestle with Asa-Thor. The tale
is not long. The result of the grapple was, that the more Thor tightened
his grasp, the firmer she stood. Then the woman began to bestir herself,
and Thor lost his footing. They had some very hard tussles, and before
long Thor was brought down on one knee. Then Utgard-Loke stepped
forward, bade them cease the wrestling, and added that Thor did not need
to challenge
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125"> </a>
anybody else to wrestle with him in his hall, besides it was now getting
late. He showed Thor and his companions to seats, and they spent the
night there enjoying the best of hospitality.</p>

<p>48. At daybreak the next day Thor and his companions arose, dressed
themselves and were ready to depart. Then came Utgard-Loke and had the
table spread for them, and there was no lack of feasting both in food
and in drink. When they had breakfasted, they immediately departed from
the burg. Utgard-Loke went with them out of the burg, but at parting he
spoke to Thor and asked him how he thought his journey had turned out,
or whether he had ever met a mightier man than himself. Thor answered
that he could not deny that he had been greatly disgraced in this
meeting; and this I know, he added, that you will call me a man of
little account, whereat I am much mortified. Then said Utgard-Loke: Now
I will tell you the truth, since you have come out of the burg, that if
I live, and may have my way, you shall never enter it again; and this I
know, forsooth, that you should never have come into it had I before
known that you were so strong, and that you had come so near bringing us
into great misfortune. Know, then, that I have deceived you with
illusions. When I first found you in the woods I came to meet you, and
when you were
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126"> </a>
to loose the provision-sack I had bound it with iron threads, but you
did not find where it was to be untied. In the next place, you struck me
three times with the hammer. The first blow was the least, and still it
was so severe that it would have been my death if it had hit me. You saw
near my burg a mountain cloven at the top into three square dales, of
which one was the deepest,&mdash;these were the dints made by your
hammer. The mountain I brought before the blows without your seeing it.
In like manner I deceived you in your contests with my courtiers. In
regard to the first, in which Loke took part, the facts were as follows:
He was very hungry and ate fast; but he whose name was Loge was
wildfire, and he burned the trough no less rapidly than the meat. When
Thjalfe ran a race with him whose name was Huge, that was my thought,
and it was impossible for him to keep pace with its swiftness. When you
drank from the horn, and thought that it diminished so little, then, by
my troth, it was a great wonder, which I never could have deemed
possible.. One end of the horn stood in the sea, but that you did not
see. When you come to the sea-shore you will discover how much the sea
has sunk by your drinking; that is now called the ebb. Furthermore he
said: Nor did it seem less wonderful to me that you lifted up the cat;
and, to tell you the truth, all
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127"> </a>
who saw it were frightened when they saw that you raised one of its feet
from the ground, for it was not such a cat as you thought. It was in
reality the Midgard-serpent, which surrounds all lands. It was scarcely
long enough to touch the earth with its tail and head, and you raised it
so high that your hand nearly reached to heaven. It was also a most
astonishing feat when you wrestled with Elle, for none has ever been,
and none shall ever be, that Elle (eld, old age) will not get the better
of him, though he gets to be old enough to abide her coming. And now the
truth is that we must part; and it will be better for us both that you
do not visit me again. I will again defend my burg with similar or other
delusions, so that you will get no power over me. When Thor heard this
tale he seized his hammer and lifted it into the air, but when he was
about to strike he saw Utgard-Loke nowhere; and when he turned back to
the burg and was going to dash that to pieces, he saw a beautiful and
large plain, but no burg. So he turned and went his way back to
Thrudvang. But it is truthfully asserted that he then resolved in his
own mind to seek that meeting with the Midgard-serpent, which afterward
took place. And now I think that no one can tell you truer tidings of
this journey of Thor.</p>

<p>49. Then said Ganglere: A most powerful
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128"> </a>
man is Utgard-Loke, though he deals much with delusions and sorcery. His
power is also proven by the fact that he had thanes who were so mighty.
But has not Thor avenged himself for this? Made answer Har: It is not
unknown, though no wise men tell thereof, how Thor made amends for the
journey that has now been spoken of. He did not remain long at home,
before he busked himself so suddenly for a new journey, that he took
neither chariot, nor goats nor any companions with him. He went out of
Midgard in the guise of a young man, and came in the evening to a giant
by name Hymer.<a class = "tag" name = "tag61" href = "#note61">61</a>
Thor tarried there as a guest through the night. In the morning Hymer
arose, dressed himself, and busked himself to row out upon the sea to
fish. Thor also sprang up, got ready in a hurry and asked Hymer whether
he might row out with him. Hymer answered that he would get but little
help from Thor, as he was so small and young; and he added, you will get
cold if I row as far out and remain as long as I am wont. Thor said that
he might row as far from shore as he pleased, for all that, and it was
yet to be seen who would be the first to ask to row back to land. And
Thor grew so wroth at the giant that he came near letting the hammer
ring on
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129"> </a>
his head straightway, but he restrained himself, for he intended to try
his strength elsewhere. He asked Hymer what they were to have for bait,
but Hymer replied that he would have to find his own bait. Then Thor
turned away to where he saw a herd of oxen, that belonged to Hymer. He
took the largest ox, which was called Himinbrjot, twisted his head off
and brought it down to the sea-strand. Hymer had then shoved the boat
off. Thor went on board and seated himself in the stern; he took two
oars and rowed so that Hymer had to confess that the boat sped fast from
his rowing. Hymer plied the oars in the bow, and thus the rowing soon
ended. Then said Hymer that they had come to the place where he was wont
to sit and catch flat-fish, but Thor said he would like to row much
farther out, and so they made another swift pull. Then said Hymer that
they had come so far out that it was dangerous to stay there, for the
Midgard-serpent. Thor said he wished to row a while longer, and so he
did; but Hymer was by no means in a happy mood. Thor took in the oars,
got ready a very strong line, and the hook was neither less nor weaker.
When he had put on the ox-head for bait, he cast it overboard and it
sank to the bottom. It must be admitted that Thor now beguiled the
Midgard-serpent not a whit less than Utgard-Loke
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130"> </a>
mocked him when he was to lift the serpent with his hand. The
Midgard-serpent took the ox-head into his mouth, whereby the hook
entered his palate, but when the serpent perceived this he tugged so
hard that both Thor’s hands were dashed against the gunwale. Now Thor
became angry, assumed his asa-might and spurned so hard that both his
feet went through the boat and he stood on the bottom of the sea. He
pulled the serpent up to the gunwale; and in truth no one has ever seen
a more terrible sight than when Thor whet his eyes on the serpent, and
the latter stared at him and spouted venom. It is said that the giant
Hymer changed hue and grew pale from fear when he saw the serpent and
beheld the water flowing into the boat; but just at the moment when Thor
grasped the hammer and lifted it in the air, the giant fumbled for his
fishing-knife and cut off Thor’s line at the gunwale, whereby the
serpent sank back into the sea. Thor threw the hammer after it, and it
is even said that he struck off his head at the bottom, but I think the
truth is that the Midgard-serpent still lives and lies in the ocean.
Thor clenched his fist and gave the giant a box on the ear so that he
fell backward into the sea, and he saw his heels last, but Thor waded
ashore.</p>

<h6>THE DEATH OF BALDER.</h6>

<p>50. Then asked Ganglere: Have there happened any other remarkable
things among the asas? A great deed it was, forsooth, that Thor wrought
on this journey. Har answered: Yes, indeed, there are tidings to be told
that seemed of far greater importance to the asas. The beginning of this
tale is, that Balder dreamed dreams great and dangerous to his life.
When he told these dreams to the asas they took counsel together, and it
was decided that they should seek peace for Balder against all kinds of
harm. So Frigg exacted an oath from fire, water, iron and all kinds of
metal, stones, earth, trees, sicknesses, beasts, birds and creeping
things, that they should not hurt Balder. When this was done and made
known, it became the pastime of Balder and the asas that he should stand
up at their meetings while some of them should shoot at him, others
should hew at him, while others should throw stones at him; but no
matter what they did, no harm came to him, and this seemed to all a
great honor. When Loke, Laufey’s son, saw this, it
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132"> </a>
displeased him very much that Balder was not scathed. So he went to
Frigg, in Fensal, having taken on himself the likeness of a woman. Frigg
asked this woman whether she knew what the asas were doing at their
meeting. She answered that all were shooting at Balder, but that he was
not scathed thereby. Then said Frigg: Neither weapon nor tree can hurt
Balder, I have taken an oath from them all. Then asked the woman: Have
all things taken an oath to spare Balder? Frigg answered: West of Valhal
there grows a little shrub that is called the mistletoe, that seemed to
me too young to exact an oath from. Then the woman suddenly disappeared.
Loke went and pulled up the mistletoe and proceeded to the meeting.
Hoder stood far to one side in the ring of men, because he was blind.
Loke addressed himself to him, and asked: Why do you not shoot at
Balder? He answered: Because I do not see where he is, and furthermore I
have no weapons. Then said Loke: Do like the others and show honor to
Balder; I will show you where he stands; shoot at him with this wand.
Hoder took the mistletoe and shot at Balder under the guidance of Loke.
The dart pierced him and he fell dead to the ground. This is the
greatest misfortune that has ever happened to gods and men. When Balder
had fallen, the asas were struck speechless with horror, and their hands
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133"> </a>
failed them to lay hold of the corpse. One looked at the other, and all
were of one mind toward him who had done the deed, but being assembled
in a holy peace-stead, no one could take vengeance. When the asas at
length tried to speak, the wailing so choked their voices that one could
not describe to the other his sorrow. Odin took this misfortune most to
heart, since he best comprehended how great a loss and injury the fall
of Balder was to the asas. When the gods came to their senses, Frigg
spoke and asked who there might be among the asas who desired to win all
her love and good will by riding the way to Hel and trying to find
Balder, and offering Hel a ransom if she would allow Balder to return
home again to Asgard. But he is called Hermod, the Nimble, Odin’s swain,
who undertook this journey. Odin’s steed, Sleipner, was led forth.
Hermod mounted him and galloped away.</p>

<p>51. The asas took the corpse of Balder and brought it to the
sea-shore. Hringhorn was the name of Balder’s ship, and it was the
largest of all ships. The gods wanted to launch it and make Balder’s
bale-fire thereon, but they could not move it. Then they sent to
Jotunheim after the giantess whose name is Hyrrokken. She came riding on
a wolf, and had twisted serpents for reins. When she alighted, Odin
appointed four berserks to take care of her steed, but they
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134"> </a>
were unable to hold him except by throwing him down on the ground.
Hyrrokken went to the prow and launched the ship with one single push,
but the motion was so violent that fire sprang from the underlaid
rollers and all the earth shook. Then Thor became wroth, grasped his
hammer, and would forthwith have crushed her skull, had not all the gods
asked peace for her. Balder’s corpse was borne out on the ship; and when
his wife, Nanna, daughter of Nep, saw this, her heart was broken with
grief and she died. She was borne to the funeral-pile and cast on the
fire. Thor stood by and hallowed the pile with Mjolner. Before his feet
ran a dwarf, whose name is Lit. Him Thor kicked with his foot and dashed
him into the fire, and he, too, was burned. But this funeral-pile was
attended by many kinds of folk. First of all came Odin, accompanied by
Frigg and the valkyries and his ravens. Frey came riding in his chariot
drawn by the boar called Gullinburste or Slidrugtanne. Heimdal rode his
steed Gulltop, and Freyja drove her cats. There was a large number of
frost-giants and mountain-giants. Odin laid on the funeral-pile his gold
ring, Draupner, which had the property of producing, every ninth night,
eight gold rings of equal weight. Balder’s horse, fully caparisoned, was
led to his master’s pile.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135"> </a>
52. But of Hermod it is to be told that he rode nine nights through deep
and dark valleys, and did not see light until he came to the
Gjallar-river and rode on the Gjallar-bridge, which is thatched with
shining gold. Modgud is the name of the may who guards the bridge. She
asked him for his name, and of what kin he was, saying that the day
before there rode five fylkes (kingdoms, bands) of dead men over the
bridge; but she added, it does not shake less under you alone, and you
do not have the hue of dead men. Why do you ride the way to Hel? He
answered: I am to ride to Hel to find Balder. Have you seen him pass
this way? She answered that Balder had ridden over the Gjallar-bridge;
adding: But downward and northward lies the way to Hel. Then Hermod rode
on till he came to Hel’s gate. He alighted from his horse, drew the
girths tighter, remounted him, clapped the spurs into him, and the horse
leaped over the gate with so much force that he never touched it.
Thereupon Hermod proceeded to the hall and alighted from his steed. He
went in, and saw there sitting on the foremost seat his brother Balder.
He tarried there over night. In the morning he asked Hel whether Balder
might ride home with him, and told how great weeping there was among the
asas. But Hel replied that it should now be tried whether Balder was so
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136"> </a>
much beloved as was said. If all things, said she, both quick and dead,
will weep for him, then he shall go back to the asas, but if anything
refuses to shed tears, then he shall remain with Hel. Hermod arose, and
Balder accompanied him out of the hall. He took the ring Draupner and
sent it as a keepsake to Odin. Nanna sent Frigg a kerchief and other
gifts, and to Fulla she sent a ring. Thereupon Hermod rode back and came
to Asgard, where he reported the tidings he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>53. Then the asas sent messengers over all the world, praying that
Balder might be wept out of Hel’s power. All things did so,&mdash;men
and beasts, the earth, stones, trees and all metals, just as you must
have seen that these things weep when they come out of frost and into
heat. When the messengers returned home and had done their errand well,
they found a certain cave wherein sat a giantess (gygr = ogress) whose
name was Thok. They requested her to weep Balder from Hel; but she
answered:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Thok will weep<br>
With dry tears<br>
For Balder’s burial;<br>
Neither in life nor in death<br>
Gave he me gladness.<br>
Let Hel keep what she has!
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137"> </a>
It is generally believed that this Thok was Loke, Laufey’s son, who has
wrought most evil among the asas.</p>

<p>54. Then said Ganglere: A very great wrong did Loke perpetrate; first
of all in causing Balder’s death, and next in standing in the way of his
being loosed from Hel. Did he get no punishment for this misdeed? Har
answered: Yes, he was repaid for this in a way that he will long
remember. The gods became exceedingly wroth, as might be expected. So he
ran away and hid himself in a rock. Here he built a house with four
doors, so that he might keep an outlook on all sides. Oftentimes in the
daytime he took on him the likeness of a salmon and concealed himself in
Frananger Force. Then he thought to himself what stratagems the asas
might have recourse to in order to catch him. Now, as he was sitting in
his house, he took flax and yarn and worked them into meshes, in the
manner that nets have since been made; but a fire was burning before
him. Then he saw that the asas were not far distant. Odin had seen from
Hlidskjalf where Loke kept himself. Loke immediately sprang up, cast the
net on the fire and leaped into the river. When the asas came to the
house, he entered first who was wisest of them all, and whose name was
Kvaser; and when he saw in the fire the ashes of the net that had
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138"> </a>
been burned, he understood that this must be a contrivance for catching
fish, and this he told to the asas. Thereupon they took flax and made
themselves a net after the pattern of that which they saw in the ashes
and which Loke had made. When the net was made, the asas went to the
river and cast it into the force. Thor held one end of the net, and all
the other asas laid hold on the other, thus jointly drawing it along the
stream. Loke went before it and laid himself down between two stones, so
that they drew the net over him, although they perceived that some
living thing touched the meshes. They went up to the force again and
cast out the net a second time. This time they hung a great weight to
it, making it so heavy that nothing could possibly pass under it. Loke
swam before the net, but when he saw that he was near the sea he sprang
over the top of the net and hastened back to the force. When the asas
saw whither he went they proceeded up to the force, dividing themselves
into two bands, but Thor waded in the middle of the stream, and so they
dragged the net along to the sea. Loke saw that he now had only two
chances of escape,&mdash;either to risk his life and swim out to sea, or
to leap again over the net. He chose the latter, and made a tremendous
leap over the top line of the net. Thor grasped after him and caught
him, but he slipped in his hand so that
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139"> </a>
Thor did not get a firm hold before he got to the tail, and this is the
reason why the salmon has so slim a tail. Now Loke was taken without
truce and was brought to a cave. The gods took three rocks and set them
up on edge, and bored a hole through each rock. Then they took Loke’s
sons, Vale and Nare or Narfe. Vale they changed into the likeness of a
wolf, whereupon he tore his brother Narfe to pieces, with whose
intestines the asas bound Loke over the three rocks. One stood under his
shoulders, another under his loins, and the third under his hams, and
the fetters became iron. Skade took a serpent and fastened up over him,
so that the venom should drop from the serpent into his face. But Sigyn,
his wife, stands by him, and holds a dish under the venom-drops.
Whenever the dish becomes full, she goes and pours away the venom, and
meanwhile the venom drops onto Loke’s face. Then he twists his body so
violently that the whole earth shakes, and this you call earthquakes.
There he will lie bound until Ragnarok.</p>

<h6>RAGNAROK.</h6>

<p>55. Then said Ganglere: What tidings are to be told of Ragnarok? Of
this I have never heard before. Har answered: Great things are to be
said thereof. First, there is a winter called the Fimbul-winter, when
snow drives from all quarters, the frosts are so severe, the winds so
keen and piercing, that there is no joy in the sun. There are three such
winters in succession, without any intervening summer. But before these
there are three other winters, during which great wars rage over all the
world. Brothers slay each other for the sake of gain, and no one spares
his father or mother in that manslaughter and adultery. Thus says the
Vala’s Prophecy:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Brothers will fight together<br>
And become each other’s bane;<br>
Sisters’ children<br>
Their sib shall spoil.<a class = "tag" name = "tag62" href =
"#note62">62</a><br>
Hard is the world,<br>
Sensual sins grow huge.<br>
There are ax-ages, sword-ages&mdash;<br>
Shields are cleft in twain,&mdash;<br>
There are wind-ages, wolf-ages,<br>
Ere the world falls dead.<a class = "tag" name = "tag63" href =
"#note63">63</a>
</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141"> </a>
Then happens what will seem a great miracle, that the wolf<a class =
"tag" name = "tag64" href = "#note64">64</a> devours the sun, and this
will seem a great loss. The other wolf will devour the moon, and this
too will cause great mischief. The stars shall be Hurled from heaven.
Then it shall come to pass that the earth and the mountains will shake
so violently that trees will be torn up by the roots, the mountains will
topple down, and all bonds and fetters will be broken and snapped. The
Fenris-wolf gets loose. The sea rushes over the earth, for the
Midgard-serpent writhes in giant rage and seeks to gain the land. The
ship that is called Naglfar also becomes loose. It is made of the nails
of dead men; wherefore it is worth warning that, when a man dies with
unpared nails, he supplies a large amount of materials for the building
of this ship, which both gods and men wish may be finished as late as
possible. But in this flood Naglfar gets afloat. The giant Hrym is its
steersman. The Fenris-wolf advances with wide open mouth; the upper jaw
reaches to heaven and the lower jaw is on the earth. He would open it
still wider had he room. Fire flashes from his eyes and nostrils. The
Midgard-serpent vomits forth venom, defiling all the air and the sea; he
is very terrible, and places himself by the side of the wolf. In the
midst of this clash and din
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142"> </a>
the heavens are rent in twain, and the sons of Muspel come riding
through the opening. Surt rides first, and before him and after him
flames burning fire. He has a very good sword, which shines brighter
than the sun. As they ride over Bifrost it breaks to pieces, as has
before been stated. The sons of Muspel direct their course to the plain
which is called Vigrid. Thither repair also the Fenris-wolf and the
Midgard-serpent. To this place have also come Loke and Hrym, and with
him all the frost-giants. In Loke’s company are all the friends of Hel.
The sons of Muspel have there effulgent bands alone by themselves. The
plain Vigrid is one hundred miles (rasts) on each side.</p>

<p>56. While these things are happening, Heimdal stands up, blows with
all his might in the Gjallar-horn and awakens all the gods, who
thereupon hold counsel. Odin rides to Mimer’s well to ask advice of
Mimer for himself and his folk. Then quivers the ash Ygdrasil, and all
things in heaven and earth fear and tremble. The asas and the einherjes
arm themselves and speed forth to the battle-field. Odin rides first;
with his golden helmet, resplendent byrnie, and his spear Gungner, he
advances against the Fenris-wolf. Thor stands by his side, but can give
him no assistance, for he has his hands full in his struggle with the
Midgard-serpent. Frey encounters
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143"> </a>
Surt, and heavy blows are exchanged ere Frey falls. The cause of his
death is that he has not that good sword which he gave to Skirner. Even
the dog Garm, that was bound before the Gnipa-cave, gets loose. He is
the greatest plague. He contends with Tyr, and they kill each other.
Thor gets great renown by slaying the Midgard-serpent, but retreats only
nine paces when he falls to the earth dead, poisoned by the venom that
the serpent blows on him. The wolf swallows Odin, and thus causes his
death; but Vidar immediately turns and rushes at the wolf, placing one
foot on his nether jaw. On this foot he has the shoe for which materials
have been gathering through all ages, namely, the strips of leather
which men cut off for the toes and heels of shoes; wherefore he who
wishes to render assistance to the asas must cast these strips away.
With one hand Vidar seizes the upper jaw of the wolf, and thus rends
asunder his mouth. Thus the wolf perishes. Loke fights with Heimdal, and
they kill each other. Thereupon Surt flings fire over the earth and
burns up all the world. Thus it is said in the Vala’s Prophecy:</p>

<h6>REGENERATION.</h6>

<p>57. Then asked Ganglere: What happens when heaven and earth and all
the world are consumed in flames, and when all the gods and all the
einherjes and all men are dead? You have already said that all men shall
live in some world through all ages. Har answered: There are many good
and many bad abodes. Best it is to be in Gimle, in heaven. Plenty is
there of good drink for those who deem this a joy in the hall called
Brimer. That is also in heaven. There is also an excellent hall which
stands on the Nida mountains. It is built of red gold, and is called
Sindre. In this hall good and well-minded men shall dwell. Nastrand is a
large and terrible hall, and its doors open to the north. It is built of
serpents wattled together, and all the heads of the serpents turn into
the hall and vomit forth venom that flows in streams along the hall, and
in these streams wade perjurers and murderers. So it is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
A hall I know standing<br>
Far from the sun<br>
On the strand of dead bodies.
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148"> </a><br>

Fall through the loop-holes.<br>
Of serpents’ backs<br>
The hall is made.</p>

<p class = "verse">

And murderers.
</p>

<p>But in Hvergelmer it is worst.</p>

<p class = "verse">
There tortures Nidhug<br>
The bodies of the dead.<a class = "tag" name = "tag71" href =
"#note71">71</a>
</p>

<p>58. Then said Ganglere: Do any gods live then? Is there any earth or
heaven? Har answered: The earth rises again from the sea, and is green
and fair. The fields unsown produce their harvests. Vidar and Vale live.
Neither the sea nor Surfs fire has harmed them, and they dwell on the
plains of Ida, where Asgard was before. Thither come also the sons of
Thor, Mode and Magne, and they have Mjolner. Then come Balder and Hoder
from Hel. They all sit together and talk about the things that happened
aforetime,&mdash;about the Midgard-serpent and the Fenris-wolf. They
find in the grass those golden tables which the asas once had. Thus it
is said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Vidar and Vale<br>
Dwell in the house of the gods,<br>
When quenched is the fire of Surt.
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>

Mode and Magne<br>
Vingner’s Mjolner shall have<br>
When the fight is ended.<a class = "tag" name = "tag72" href =
"#note72">72</a>
</p>

<p>In a place called Hodmimer’s-holt<a class = "tag" name = "tag73" href
= "#note73">73</a> are concealed two persons during Surt’s fire, called
Lif and Lifthraser. They feed on the morning dew. From these so numerous
a race is descended that they fill the whole world with people, as is
here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Lif and Lifthraser<br>
Will lie hid<br>
In Hodmimer’s-holt.<br>
The morning dew<br>
They have for food.<br>
From them are the races descended.<a class = "tag" name = "tag74" href =
"#note74">74</a>
</p>

<p>But what will seem wonderful to you is that the sun has brought forth
a daughter not less fair than herself, and she rides in the heavenly
course of her mother, as is here said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
A daughter<br>
Is born of the sun<br>
Ere Fenrer takes her.<br>
In her mother’s course<br>
When the gods are dead<br>
This maid shall ride.<a class = "tag" name = "tag75" href =
"#note75">75</a>
</p>

<p>And if you now can ask more questions, said Har to Ganglere, I know
not whence that power came to you. I have never heard any one tell
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150"> </a>
further the fate of the world. Make now the best use you can of what has
been told&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>59. Then Ganglere heard a terrible noise on all sides, and when he
looked about him he stood out-doors on a level plain. He saw neither
hall nor burg. He went his way and came back to his kingdom, and told
the tidings which he had seen and heard, and ever since those tidings
have been handed down from man to&nbsp;man.</p>

<h6>TO THE FOOLING OF GYLFE.</h6>

<p>The asas now sat down to talk, and held their counsel, and remembered
all the tales that were told to Gylfe. They gave the very same names
that had been named before to the men and places that were there. This
they did for the reason that, when a long time has elapsed, men should
not doubt that those asas of whom these tales were now told and those to
whom the same names were given were all identical. There was one who is
called Thor, and he is Asa-Thor, the old. He is Oku-Thor, and to him are
ascribed the great deeds done by Hektor in Troy. But men think that the
Turks have told of Ulysses, and have called him Loke, for the Turks were
his greatest enemies.</p>

<h4><a name = "brage_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h6>ÆGER’S JOURNEY TO ASGARD.</h6>

<p>1. A man by name Æger, or Hler, who dwelt on the island called Hler’s
Isle, was well skilled in the black art. He made a journey to Asgard.
But the asas knew of his coming and gave him a friendly reception; but
they also made use of many sorts of delusions. In the evening, when the
feast began, Odin had swords brought into the hall, and they were so
bright that it glistened from them so that there was no need of any
other light while they sat drinking. Then went the asas to their feast,
and the twelve asas who were appointed judges seated themselves in their
high-seats. These are their names: Thor, Njord, Frey, Tyr, Heimdal,
Brage, Vidar, Vale, Uller, Honer, Forsete, Loke. The asynjes (goddesses)
also were with them: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Idun, Gerd, Sigyn, Fulla,
Nanna. Æger thought all that he saw looked very grand. The panels of the
walls
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154"> </a>
were all covered with beautiful shields. The mead was very strong, and
they drank deep. Next to Æger sat Brage, and they talked much together
over their drink. Brage spoke to Æger of many things that had happened
to the asas.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<a name = "page155"> </a>
<h4 class = "section"><a name = "brage_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h6>IDUN AND HER APPLES.</h6>

<p>2. Brage began his tale by telling how three asas, Odin, Loke and
Honer, went on a journey over mountains and heaths, where they could get
nothing to eat. But when they came down into a valley they saw a herd of
cattle. From this herd they took an ox and went to work to boil it. When
they deemed that it must be boiled enough they uncovered the broth, but
it was not yet done. After a little while they lifted the cover off
again, but it was not yet boiled. They talked among themselves about how
this could happen. Then they heard a voice in the oak above them, and he
who sat there said that he was the cause that the broth did not get
boiled. They looked up and saw an eagle, and it was not a small one.
Then said the eagle: If you will give me my fill of the ox, then the
broth will be boiled. They agreed to this. So he flew down from the
tree, seated himself beside the boiling broth, and immediately snatched
up first the two thighs of the ox and then both the shoulders. This made
Loke wroth: he grasped a large pole, raised it with all
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156"> </a>
his might and dashed it at the body of the eagle. The eagle shook
himself after the blow and flew up. One end of the pole fastened itself
to the body of the eagle, and the other end stuck to Loke’s hands. The
eagle flew just high enough so that Loke’s feet were dragged over stones
and rocks and trees, and it seemed to him that his arms would be torn
from his shoulder-blades. He calls and prays the eagle most earnestly
for peace, but the latter declares that Loke shall never get free unless
he will pledge himself to bring Idun and her apples out of Asgard. When
Loke had promised this, he was set free and went to his companions
again; and no more is related of this journey, except that they returned
home. But at the time agreed upon, Loke coaxed Idun out of Asgard into a
forest, saying that he had found apples that she would think very nice,
and he requested her to take with her her own apples in order to compare
them. Then came the giant Thjasse in the guise of an eagle, seized Idun
and flew away with her to his home in Thrymheim. The asas were ill at
ease on account of the disappearance of Idun,&mdash;they became
gray-haired and old. They met in council and asked each other who last
had seen Idun. The last that had been seen of her was that she had gone
out of Asgard in company with Loke. Then Loke was seized and brought
into the council,
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157"> </a>
and he was threatened with death or torture. But he became frightened,
and promised to bring Idun back from Jotunheim if Freyja would lend him
the falcon-guise that she had. He got the falcon-guise, flew north into
Jotunheim, and came one day to the giant Thjasse. The giant had rowed
out to sea, and Idun was at home alone. Loke turned her into the
likeness of a nut, held her in his claws and flew with all his might.
But when Thjasse returned home and missed Idun, he took on his
eagle-guise, flew after Loke, gaining on the latter with his eagle
wings. When the asas saw the falcon coming flying with the nut, and how
the eagle flew, they went to the walls of Asgard and brought with them
bundles of plane-shavings. When the falcon flew within the burg, he let
himself drop down beside the burg-wall. Then the asas kindled a fire in
the shavings; and the eagle, being unable to stop himself when he missed
the falcon, caught fire in his feathers, so that he could not fly any
farther. The asas were on hand and slew the giant Thjasse within the
gates of Asgard, and that slaughter is most famous.</p>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "brage_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h6>HOW NJORD GOT SKADE TO WIFE.</h6>

<p>Skade, the daughter of the giant Thjasse, donned her helmet, and
byrnie, and all her war-gear, and betook herself to Asgard to avenge her
father’s death. The asas offered her ransom and atonement; and it was
agreed to, in the first place, that she should choose herself a husband
among the asas, but she was to make her choice by the feet, which was
all she was to see of their persons. She saw one man’s feet that were
wonderfully beautiful, and exclaimed: This one I choose! On Balder there
are few blemishes. But it was Njord, from Noatun. In the second place,
it was stipulated that the asas were to do what she did not deem them
capable of, and that was to make her laugh. Then Loke tied one end of a
string fast to the beard of a goat and the other around his own body,
and one pulled this way and the other that, and both of them shrieked
out loud. Then Loke let himself fall on Skade’s knees, and this made her
laugh. It is said that Odin did even more than was asked, in that he
took Thjasse’s eyes and
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159"> </a>
cast them up into heaven, and made two stars of them. Then said Æger:
This Thjasse seems to me to have been considerable of a man; of what kin
was he? Brage answered: His father’s name was Olvalde, and if I told you
of him, you would deem it very remarkable. He was very rich in gold, and
when he died and his sons were to divide their heritage, they had this
way of measuring the gold, that each should take his mouthful of gold,
and they should all take the same number of mouthfuls. One of them was
Thjasse, another Ide, and the third Gang. But we now have it as a saw
among us, that we call gold the mouth-number of these giants. In runes
and songs we wrap the gold up by calling it the measure, or word, or
tale, of these giants. Then said Æger: It seems to me that it will be
well hidden in the runes.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160"> </a>
<h4 class = "section"><a name = "brage_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h6>THE ORIGIN OF POETRY.</h6>

<p>3. And again said Æger: Whence originated the art that is called
skaldship? Made answer Brage: The beginning of this was, that the gods
had a war with the people that are called vans. They agreed to hold a
meeting for the purpose of making peace, and settled their dispute in
this wise, that they both went to a jar and spit into it. But at parting
the gods, being unwilling to let this mark of peace perish, shaped it
into a man whose name was Kvaser, and who was so wise that no one could
ask him any question that he could not answer. He traveled much about in
the world to teach men wisdom. Once he came to the home of the dwarfs
Fjalar and Galar. They called him aside, saying they wished to speak
with him alone, slew him and let his blood run into two jars called Son
and Bodn, and into a kettle called Odrarer. They mixed honey with the
blood, and thus was produced such mead that whoever drinks from it
becomes a skald and sage. The dwarfs told the asas that Kvaser had
choked in his wisdom, because no one was so wise that he could ask him
enough about learning.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161"> </a>
4. Then the dwarfs invited to themselves the giant whose name is
Gilling, and his wife; and when he came they asked him to row out to sea
with them. When they had gotten a short distance from shore, the dwarfs
rowed onto a blind rock and capsized the boat. Gilling, who was unable
to swim, was drowned, but the dwarfs righted the boat again and rowed
ashore. When they told of this mishap to his wife she took it much to
heart, and began to cry aloud. Then Fjalar asked her whether it would
not lighten her sorrow if she could look out upon the sea where her
husband had perished, and she said it would. He then said to his brother
Galar that he should go up over the doorway, and as she passed out he
should let a mill-stone drop onto her head, for he said he was tired of
her bawling, Galar did so. When the giant Suttung, the son of Gilling,
found this out he came and seized the dwarfs, took them out to sea and
left them on a rocky island, which was flooded at high tide. They prayed
Suttung to spare their lives, and offered him in atonement for their
father’s blood the precious mead, which he accepted. Suttung brought the
mead home with him, and hid it in a place called Hnitbjorg. He set his
daughter Gunlad to guard it. For these reasons we call songship Kvaser’s
blood; the drink of the dwarfs; the dwarfs’ fill; some kind of liquor of
Odrarer,
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162"> </a>
or Bodn or Son; the ship of the dwarfs (because this mead ransomed their
lives from the rocky isle); the mead of Suttung, or the liquor of
Hnitbjorg.</p>

<p>5. Then remarked Æger: It seems dark to me to call songship by these
names; but how came the asas by Suttung’s mead? Answered Brage: The saga
about this is, that Odin set out from home and came to a place where
nine thralls were mowing hay. He asked them whether they would like to
have him whet their scythes. To this they said yes. Then he took a
whet-stone from his belt and whetted the scythes. They thought their
scythes were much improved, and asked whether the whet-stone was for
sale. He answered that he who would buy it must pay a fair price for it.
All said they were willing to give the sum demanded, and each wanted
Odin to sell it to him. But he threw the whet-stone up in the air, and
when all wished to catch it they scrambled about it in such a manner
that each brought his scythe onto the other’s neck. Odin sought lodgings
for the night at the house of the giant Bauge, who was a brother of
Suttung. Bauge complained of what had happened to his household, saying
that his nine thralls had slain each other, and that he did not know
where he should get other workmen. Odin called himself Bolverk. He
offered to undertake
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163"> </a>
the work of the nine men for Bauge, but asked in payment therefor a
drink of Suttung’s mead. Bauge answered that he had no control over the
mead, saying that Suttung was bound to keep that for himself alone. But
he agreed to go with Bolverk and try whether they could get the mead.
During the summer Bolverk did the work of the nine men for Bauge, but
when winter came he asked for his pay. Then they both went to Suttung.
Bauge explained to Suttung his bargain with Bolverk, but Suttung stoutly
refused to give even a drop of the mead. Bolverk then proposed to Bauge
that they should try whether they could not get at the mead by the aid
of some trick, and Bauge agreed to this. Then Bolverk drew forth the
auger which is called Rate, and requested Bauge to bore a hole through
the rock, if the auger was sharp enough. He did so. Then said Bauge that
there was a hole through the rock; but Bolverk blowed into the hole that
the auger had made, and the chips flew back into his face. Thus he saw
that Bauge intended to deceive him, and commanded him to bore through.
Bauge bored again, and when Bolverk blew a second time the chips flew
inward. Now Bolverk changed himself into the likeness of a serpent and
crept into the auger-hole. Bauge thrust after him with the auger, but
missed him. Bolverk went to where Gunlad was, and shared
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164"> </a>
her couch for three nights. She then promised to give him three draughts
from the mead. With the first draught he emptied Odrarer, in the second
Bodn, and in the third Son, and thus he had all the mead. Then he took
on the guise of an eagle, and flew off as fast as he could. When Suttung
saw the flight of the eagle, he also took on the shape of an eagle and
flew after him. When the asas saw Odin coming, they set their jars out
in the yard. When Odin reached Asgard, he spewed the mead up into the
jars. He was, however, so near being caught by Suttung, that he sent
some of the mead after him backward, and as no care was taken of this,
anybody that wished might have it. This we call the share of poetasters.
But Suttung’s mead Odin gave to the asas and to those men who are able
to make verses. Hence we call songship Odin’s prey, Odin’s find, Odin’s
drink, Odin’s gift, and the drink of the asas.</p>

<p>6. Then said Æger: In how many ways do you vary the poetical
expressions, or how many kinds of poetry are there? Answered Brage:
There are two kinds, and all poetry falls into one or the other of these
classes. Æger asks: Which two? Brage answers: Diction and meter. What
diction is used in poetry? There are three sorts of poetic diction.
Which? One is to name everything by its own name; another is to name it
with a pronoun,
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<a name = "page165"> </a>
but the third sort of diction is called <i>kenning</i> (a&nbsp;poetical
periphrasis or descriptive name); and this sort is so managed that when
we name Odin, or Thor or Tyr, or any other of the asas or elves, we add
to their name a reference to some other asa, or we make mention of some
of his works. Then the appellation belongs to him who corresponds to the
whole phrase, and not to him who was actually named. Thus we speak of
Odin as Sigtyr, Hangatyr or Farmatyr, and such names we call simple
appellatives. In the same manner he is called Reidartyr.</p>

<h6>TO BRAGE’S TALK.</h6>


<p>Now it is to be said to young skalds who are desirous of acquiring
the diction of poetry, or of increasing their store of words with old
names, or, on the other hand, are eager to understand what is obscurely
sung, that they must master this book for their instruction and pastime.
These sagas are not to be so forgotten or disproved as to take away from
poetry old periphrases which great skalds have been pleased with. But
christian men should not believe in heathen gods, nor in the truth of
these sagas, otherwise than is explained in the beginning of this book,
where the events are explained which led men away from the true faith,
and where it, in the next place, is told of the Turks how the men from
Asia, who are called asas, falsified the tales of the things that
happened in Troy, in order that the people should believe them to be
gods.</p>

<p>King Priam in Troy was a great chief over all the Turkish host, and
his sons were the most distinguished men in his whole army. That
excellent hall, which the asas called Brime’s Hall, or
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167"> </a>
beer-hall, was King Priam’s palace. As for the long tale that they tell
of Ragnarok, that is the wars of the Trojans. When it is said that
Oku-Thor angled with an ox-head and drew on board the Midgard-serpent,
but that the serpent kept his life and sank back into the sea, then this
is another version of the story that Hektor slew Volukrontes, a famous
hero, in the presence of Achilleus, and so drew the latter onto him with
the head of the slain, which they likened unto the head of an ox, which
Oku-Thor had torn off. When Achilleus was drawn into this danger, on
account of his daring, it was the salvation of his life that he fled
from the fatal blows of Hektor, although he was wounded. It is also said
that Hektor waged the war so mightily, and that his rage was so great
when he caught sight of Achilleus, that nothing was so strong that it
could stand before him. When he missed Achilleus, who had fled, he
soothed his wrath by slaying the champion called Roddros. But the asas
say that when Oku-Thor missed the serpent, he slew the giant Hymer. In
Ragnarok the Midgard serpent came suddenly upon Thor and blew venom onto
him, and thus struck him dead. But the asas could not make up their
minds to say that this had been the fate of Oku-Thor, that anyone stood
over him dead, though this had so happened. They rushed headlong over
old sagas
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168"> </a>
more than was true when they said that the Midgard-serpent there got his
death; and they added this to the story, that Achilleus reaped the fame
of Hektor’s death, though he lay dead on the same battle-field on that
account. This was the work of Elenus and Alexander, and Elenus the asas
call Ale. They say that he avenged his brother, and that he lived when
all the gods were dead, and after the fire was quenched that burned up
Asgard and all the possessions of the gods. Pyrrhos they compared with
the Fenris-wolf. He slew Odin, and Pyrrhos might be called a wolf
according to their belief, for he did not spare the peace-steads, when
he slew the king in the temple before the altar of Thor. The burning of
Troy they call the flame of Surt. Mode and Magne, the sons of Oku-Thor,
came to crave the land of Ale or Vidar. He is Æneas. He came away from

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_hrungner">THOR AND
HRUNGNER.</a></h5>

<p>Brage told Æger that Thor had gone eastward to crush trolls. Odin
rode on his horse Sleipner to Jotunheim, and came to the giant whose
name is Hrungner. Then asked Hrungner what man that was who with a
golden helmet rode both through the air and over the sea, and added that
he had a remarkably good horse. Odin said that he would wager his head
that so good a horse could not be found in Jotunheim. Hrungner admitted
that it was indeed an excellent horse, but he had one, called Goldfax,
that could take much longer paces; and in his wrath he immediately
sprang upon his horse and galloped after Odin, intending to pay him for
his insolence. Odin rode so fast that he was a good distance ahead, but
Hrungner had worked himself into such a giant rage that, before he was
aware of it, he had come within the gates of Asgard.
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170"> </a>
When he came to the hall door, the asas invited him to drink with them.
He entered the hall and requested a drink. They then took the bowls that
Thor was accustomed to drink from, and Hrungner emptied them all. When
he became drunk, he gave the freest vent to his loud boastings. He said
he was going to take Valhal and move it to Jotunheim, demolish Asgard
and kill all the gods except Freyja and Sif, whom he was going to take
home with him. When Freyja went forward to refill the bowls for him, he
boasted that he was going to drink up all the ale of the asas. But when
the asas grew weary of his arrogance, they named Thor’s name. At once
Thor was in the hall, swung his hammer in the air, and, being
exceedingly wroth, asked who was to blame that dog-wise giants were
permitted to drink there, who had given Hrungner permission to be in
Valhal, and why Freyja should pour ale for him as she did in the feasts
of the asas. Then answered Hrungner, looking with anything but friendly
eyes at Thor, and said that Odin had invited him to drink, and that he
was there under his protection. Thor replied that he should come to rue
that invitation before he came out. Hrungner again answered that it
would be but little credit to Asa-Thor to kill him, unarmed as he was.
It would be a greater proof of his valor if he dared fight a duel
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171"> </a>
with him at the boundaries of his territory, at Grjottungard. It was
very foolish of me, he said, that I left my shield and my flint-stone at
home; had I my weapons here, you and I would try a holmgang (duel on a
rocky island); but as this is not the case, I declare you a coward if
you kill me unarmed. Thor was by no means the man to refuse to fight a
duel when he was challenged, an honor which never had been shown him
before. Then Hrungner went his way, and hastened with all his might back
to Jotunheim. His journey became famous among the giants, and the
proposed meeting with Thor was much talked of. They regarded it very
important who should gain the victory, and they feared the worst from
Thor if Hrungner should be defeated, for he was the strongest among
them. Thereupon the giants made at Grjottungard a man of clay, who was
nine rasts tall and three rasts broad under the arms, but being unable
to find a heart large enough to be suitable for him, they took the heart
from a mare, but even this fluttered and trembled when Thor came.
Hrungner had, as is well known, a heart of stone, sharp and three-sided;
just as the rune has since been risted that is called Hrungner’s heart.
Even his head was of stone. His shield was of stone, and was broad and
thick, and he was holding this shield before him as he stood at
Grjottungard waiting
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172"> </a>
for Thor. His weapon was a flint-stone, which he swung over his
shoulders, and altogether he presented a most formidable aspect. On one
side of him stood the giant of clay, who was named Mokkerkalfe. He was
so exceedingly terrified, that it is said that he wet himself when he
saw Thor. Thor proceeded to the duel, and Thjalfe was with him. Thjalfe
ran forward to where Hrungner was standing, and said to him: You stand
illy guarded, giant; you hold the shield before you, but Thor has seen
you; he goes down into the earth and will attack you from below. Then
Hrungner thrust the shield under his feet and stood on it, but the
flint-stone he seized with both his hands. The next that he saw were
flashes of lightning, and he heard loud crashings; and then he saw Thor
in his asa-might advancing with impetuous speed, swinging his hammer and
hurling it from afar at Hrungner. Hrungner seized the flint-stone with
both his hands and threw it against the hammer. They met in the air, and
the flint-stone broke. One part fell to the earth, and from it have come
the flint-mountains; the other part hit Thor’s head with such force that
he fell forward to the ground. But the hammer Mjolner hit Hrungner right
in the head, and crushed his skull in small pieces. He himself fell
forward over Thor, so that his foot lay upon Thor’s neck. Meanwhile
Thjalfe
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173"> </a>
attacked Mokkerkalfe, who fell with but little honor. Then Thjalfe went
to Thor and was to take Hrungner’s foot off from him, but he had not the
strength to do it. When the asas learned that Thor had fallen, they all
came to take the giant’s foot off, but none of them was able to move it.
Then came Magne, the son of Thor and Jarnsaxa. He was only three nights
of age. He threw Hrungner’s foot off Thor, and said It was a great
mishap, father, that I came so late. I think I could have slain this
giant with my fist, had I met him. Then Thor arose, greeted his son
lovingly, saying that he would become great and powerful; and, added he,
I will give you the horse Goldfax, that belonged to Hrungner. Odin said
that Thor did wrong in giving so fine a horse to the son of a giantess,
instead of to his father. Thor went home to Thrudvang, but the
flint-stone still stuck fast in his head. Then came the vala whose name
is Groa, the wife of Orvandel the Bold. She sang her magic songs over
Thor until the flint-stone became loose. But when Thor perceived this,
and was just expecting that the flint-stone would disappear, he desired
to reward Groa for her healing, and make her heart glad. So he related
to her how he had waded from the north over the Elivogs rivers, and had
borne in a basket on his back Orvandel from Jotunheim; and in evidence
of this he told
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174"> </a>
her how that one toe of his had protruded from the basket and had
frozen, wherefore Thor had broken it off and had cast it up into the
sky, and made of it the star which is called Orvandel’s toe. Finally he
added that it would not be long before Orvandel would come home. But
Groa became so glad that she forgot her magic songs, and so the
flint-stone became no looser than it was, and it sticks fast in Thor’s
head yet. For this reason it is forbidden to throw a flint-stone across
the floor, for then the stone in Thor’s head is moved. Out of this saga
Thjodolf of Hvin has made a song:</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_journey">THOR’S JOURNEY TO
GEIRROD’S.</a></h5>

<p>Then said Æger: Much of a man, it seems to me, was that Hrungner. Has
Thor accomplished any other great deeds in his intercourse with trolls
(giants)? Then answered Brage: It is worth giving a full account of how
Thor made a journey to Geirrodsgard. He had with him neither the hammer
Mjolner, nor his belt of strength, Megingjard, nor his steel gloves; and
that was Loke’s fault,&mdash;he was with him. For it had happened to
Loke, when he once flew out to amuse himself in Frigg’s falcon-guise,
that he, out of curiosity, flew into Geirrodsgard, where he saw a large
hall. He sat down and looked in through the window, but Geirrod
discovered him, and ordered the bird to be caught and brought to him.
The servant had hard work to climb up the wall of the hall, so high was
it. It amused Loke that it gave the servant so much trouble to get at
him, and he thought it would be time enough to fly away when he
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177"> </a>
had gotten over the worst. When the latter now caught at him, Loke
spread his wings and spurned with his feet, but these were fast, and so
Loke was caught and brought to the giant. When the latter saw his eyes
he suspected that it was a man. He put questions to him and bade him
answer, but Loke refused to speak. Then Geirrod locked him down in a
chest, and starved him for three months; and when Geirrod finally took
him up again, and asked him to speak, Loke confessed who he was, and to
save his life he swore an oath to Geirrod that he would get Thor to come
to Geirrodsgard without his hammer or his belt of strength.</p>

<p>On his way Thor visited the giantess whose name is Grid. She was the
mother of Vidar the Silent. She told Thor the truth concerning Geirrod,
that he was a dog-wise and dangerous giant; and she lent him her own
belt of strength and steel gloves, and her staff, which is called
Gridarvol. Then went Thor to the river which is called Vimer, and which
is the largest of all rivers. He buckled on the belt of strength and
stemmed the wild torrent with Gridarvol, but Loke held himself fast in
Megingjard. When Thor had come into the middle of the stream, the river
waxed so greatly that the waves dashed over his shoulders. Then quoth
Thor:</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178"> </a></p>
<p class = "verse">
Wax not Vimer,<br>
Since I intend to wade<br>
To the gards of giants.<br>
Know, if you wax,<br>
Then waxes my asa-might<br>
As high, as the heavens.
</p>

<p>Then Thor looked up and saw in a cleft Gjalp, the daughter of
Geirrod, standing on both sides of the stream, and causing its growth.
Then took he up out of the river a huge stone and threw at her, saying:
At its source the stream must be stemmed.<a class = "tag" name = "tag88"
href = "#note88">88</a> He was not wont to miss his mark. At the same
time he reached the river bank and got hold of a shrub, and so he got
out of the river. Hence comes the adage that <i>a shrub saved
Thor</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag89" href = "#note89">89</a> When
Thor came to Geirrod, he and his companion were shown to the guest-room,
where lodgings were given them, but there was but one seat, and on that
Thor sat down. Then he became aware that the seat was raised under him
toward the roof. He put the Gridarvol against the rafters, and pressed
himself down against the seat. Then was heard a great crash, which was
followed by a loud screaming. Under the seat were Geirrod’s daughters,
Gjalp and Greip, and he had broken the backs of both of them. Then quoth
Thor:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Once I employed<br>
My asa-might<br>
In the gards of the giants.
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179"> </a><br>
When Gjalp and Greip,<br>
Geirrod’s daughters,<br>
Wanted to lift me to heaven.
</p>

<p>Then Geirrod had Thor invited into the hall to the games. Large fires
burned along the whole length of the hall. When Thor came into the hall,
and stood opposite Geirrod, the latter seized with a pair of tongs a
red-hot iron wedge and threw it at Thor. But he caught it with his steel
gloves, and lifted it up in the air. Geirrod sprang behind an iron post
to guard himself. But Thor threw the wedge with so great force that it
struck through the post, through Geirrod, through the wall, and then
went out and into the ground. From this saga, Eilif, son of Gudrun, made
the following song, called Thor’s Drapa:</p>

<p class = "verse">

<p>How shall gold be named? It may be called fire; the needles of
Glaser; Sif’s hair; Fulla’s head-gear; Freyja’s tears; the chatter, talk
or word of the giants; Draupner’s drop; Draupner’s rain or shower;
Freyja’s eyes; the otter-ransom, or stroke-ransom, of the asas; the seed
of Fyrisvold; Holge’s how-roof; the fire of all waters and of the hand;
or the stone, rock or gleam of the hand.</p>

<p>Why is gold called Æger’s fire? The saga relating to this is, as has
before been told, that Æger made a visit to Asgard, but when he was
ready to return home he invited Odin and all the asas to come and pay
him a visit after the lapse of three months. On this journey went Odin,
Njord, Frey, Tyr, Brage, Vidar, Loke; and also the asynjes, Frigg,
Freyja, Gefjun, Skade, Idun, Sif. Thor was not there, for he had gone
eastward to fight trolls. When the gods had taken their seats, Æger let
his servants bring in
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188"> </a>
on the hall floor bright gold, which shone and lighted up the whole hall
like fire, just as the swords in Valhal are used instead of fire. Then
Loke bandied hasty words with all the gods, and slew Æger’s thrall who
was called Fimafeng. The name of his other thrall is Elder. The name of
Æger’s wife is Ran, and they have nine daughters, as has before been
written. At this feast all things passed around spontaneously, both food
and ale and all the utensils needed for the feasting. Then the asas
became aware that Ran had a net in which she caught all men who perish
at sea. Then the saga goes on telling how it happens that gold is called
the fire, or light or brightness of Æger, of Ran, or of Æger’s
daughters; and from these periphrases it is allowed to call gold the
fire of the sea, or of any of the periphrases of the sea, since Æger and
Ran are found in periphrases of the sea; and thus gold is now called the
fire of waters, of rivers, or of all the periphrases of rivers. But
these names have fared like other periphrases. The younger skald has
composed poetry after the pattern of the old skalds, imitating their
songs; but afterward they have expanded the metaphors whenever they
thought they could improve upon what was sung before; and thus the water
is the sea, the river is the lakes, the brook is the river. Hence all
the figures that are expanded more than what has
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189"> </a>
before been found are called new tropes, and all seem good that contain
likelihood and are natural. Thus sang the skald Brage:</p>

<p class = "verse">
From the king I received<br>
The fire of the brook.<br>
This the king gave to me<br>
And a head with song.
</p>

<p>Why is gold called the needles or leaves of Glaser? In Asgard, before
the doors of Valhal, stands a grove which is called Glaser, and all its
leaves are of red gold, as is here sung:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Glaser stands<br>
With golden leaves<br>
Before Sigtyr’s halls.
</p>

<p>This is the fairest forest among gods and men.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_wager">LOKE’S WAGER WITH THE
DWARFS.</a></h5>

<p>Why is gold called Sif’s hair? Loke Laufey’s son had once craftily
cut all the hair off Sif; but when Thor found it out he seized Loke, and
would have broken every bone in him, had he not pledged himself with an
oath to get the swarthy elves to make for Sif a hair of gold that should
grow like other hair. Then went Loke to the dwarfs that are called
Ivald’s sons, and they made the hair and Skidbladner, and the spear that
Odin owned and is called Gungner. Thereupon Loke wagered his head with
the dwarf,
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190"> </a>
who hight Brok, that his brother Sindre would not be able to make three
other treasures equally as good as these were. But when they came to the
smithy, Sindre laid a pig-skin in the furnace and requested Brok to blow
the bellows, and not to stop blowing before he (Sindre) had taken out of
the furnace what he had put into it. As soon, however, as Sindre had
gone out of the smithy and Brok was blowing, a fly lighted on his hand
and stung him; but he kept on blowing as before until the smith had
taken the work out of the furnace. That was now a boar, and its bristles
were of gold. Thereupon he laid gold in the furnace, and requested Brok
to blow, and not to stop plying the bellows before he came back. He went
out; but then came the fly and lighted on his neck and stung him still
worse; but he continued to work the bellows until the smith took out of
the furnace the gold ring called Draupner. Then Sindre placed iron in
the furnace, and requested Brok to work the bellows, adding that
otherwise all would be worthless. Now the fly lighted between his eyes
and stung his eye-lids, and as the blood ran down into his eyes so that
he could not see, he let go of the bellows just for a moment and drove
the fly away with his hands. Then the smith came back and said that all
that lay in the furnace came near being entirely spoiled. Thereupon he
took a hammer out of the furnace.
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<a name = "page191"> </a>
All these treasures he then placed in the hands of his brother Brok, and
bade him go with Loke to Asgard to fetch the wager. When Loke and Brok
brought forth the treasures, the gods seated themselves upon their
doom-steads. It was agreed to abide by the decision which should be
pronounced by Odin, Thor and Frey. Loke gave to Odin the spear Gungner,
to Thor the hair, which Sif was to have, and to Frey, Skidbladner; and
he described the qualities of all these treasures, stating that the
spear never would miss its mark, that the hair would grow as soon as it
was placed on Sif s head, and that Skidbladner would always have fair
wind as soon as the sails were hoisted, no matter where its owner
desired to go; besides, the ship could be folded together like a napkin
and be carried in his pocket if he desired. Then Brok produced his
treasures. He gave to Odin the ring, saying that every ninth night eight
other rings as heavy as it would drop from it; to Frey he gave the boar,
stating that it would run through the air and over seas, by night or by
day, faster than any horse; and never could it become so dark in the
night, or in the worlds of darkness, but that it would be light where
this boar was present, so bright shone his bristles. Then he gave to
Thor the hammer, and said that he might strike with it as hard as he
pleased; no matter what was before him, the hammer would take no scathe,
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192"> </a>
and wherever he might throw it he would never lose it; it would never
fly so far that it did not return to his hand; and if he desired, it
would become so small that he might conceal it in his bosom; but it had
one fault, which was, that the handle was rather short. The decision of
the gods was, that the hammer was the best of all these treasures and
the greatest protection against the frost-giants, and they declared that
the dwarf had fairly won the wager. Then Loke offered to ransom his
head. The dwarf answered saying there was no hope for him on that score.
Take me, then! said Loke; but when the dwarf was to seize him Loke was
far away, for he had the shoes with which he could run through the air
and over the sea. Then the dwarf requested Thor to seize him, and he did
so. Now the dwarf wanted to cut the head off Loke, but Loke said that
the head was his, but not the neck. Then the dwarf took thread and a
knife and wanted to pierce holes in Loke’s lips, so as to sew his mouth
together, but the knife would not cut. Then said he, it would be better
if he had his brother’s awl, and as soon as he named it the awl was
there and it pierced Loke’s lips. Now Brok sewed Loke’s mouth together,
and broke off the thread at the end of the sewing. The thread with which
the mouth of Loke was sewed together is called Vartare
(a&nbsp;strap).</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_niflungs">THE NIFLUNGS AND
GJUKUNGS.</a></h5>

<p>The following is the reason why gold is called otter-ransom: It is
related that three asas went abroad to learn to know the whole world,
Odin, Honer and Loke. They came to a river, and walked along the
river-bank to a force, and near the force was an otter. The otter had
caught a salmon in the force, and sat eating it with his eyes closed.
Loke picked up a stone, threw it at the otter and hit him in the head.
Loke bragged of his chase, for he had secured an otter and a salmon with
one throw. They took the salmon and the otter with them, and came to a
byre, where they entered. But the name of the bonde who lived there was
Hreidmar. He was a mighty man, and thoroughly skilled in the black art.
The asas asked for night-lodgings, stating that they had plenty of food,
and showed the bonde their game. But when Hreidmar saw the otter he
called his sons, Fafner and Regin, and said that Otter, their brother,
was slain, and also told who had done it. Then the father and the sons
attacked the asas, seized them and bound them, and then said, in
reference to the otter, that he was Hreidmar’s son. The asas offered, as
a ransom for their lives, as much money as Hreidmar himself might
demand, and this was agreed to, and confirmed with an oath. Then the
otter was
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<a name = "page194"> </a>
flayed. Hreidmar took the otter-belg and said to them that they should
fill the belg with red gold, and then cover it with the same metal, and
when this was done they should be set free. Thereupon Odin sent Loke to
the home of the swarthy elves, and he came to the dwarf whose name is
Andvare, and who lived as a fish, in the water. Loke caught him in his
hands, and demanded of him, as a ransom for his life, all the gold that
he had in his rock. And when they entered the rock, the dwarf produced
all the gold that he owned, and that was a very large amount. Then the
dwarf concealed in his hand a small gold ring. Loke saw this, and
requested him to hand forth the ring. The dwarf begged him not to take
the ring away from him, for with this ring he could increase his wealth
again if he kept it. Loke said the dwarf should not keep as much as a
penny, took the ring from him and went out. But the dwarf said that that
ring should be the bane of every one who possessed it. Loke replied that
he was glad of this, and said that all should be fulfilled according to
his prophecy: he would take care to bring the curse to the ears of him
who was to receive it. He went to Hreidmar and showed Odin the gold; but
when the latter saw the ring, it seemed to him a fair one, and he took
it and put it aside, giving Hreidmar the rest of the gold. They filled
the
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195"> </a>
otter-belg as full as it would hold, and raised it up when it was full.
Then came Odin, and was to cover the belg with gold; and when this was
done, he requested Hreidmar to come and see whether the belg was
sufficiently covered. But Hreidmar looked at it, examined it closely,
and saw a mouth-hair, and demanded that it should be covered, too,
otherwise the agreement would be broken. Then Odin brought forth the
ring and covered with it the mouth-hair, saying that now they had paid
the otter-ransom. But when Odin had taken his spear, and Loke his shoes,
so that they had nothing more to fear, Loke said that the curse that
Andvare had pronounced should be fulfilled, and that the ring and that
gold should be the bane of its possessor; and this curse was afterward
fulfilled. This explains why gold is called the otter-ransom, or forced
payment of the asas, or strife-metal.</p>

<p>What more is there to be told of this gold? Hreidmar accepted the
gold as a ransom for his son, but Fafner and Regin demanded their share
of it as a ransom for their brother. Hreidmar was, however, unwilling to
give them as much as a penny of it. Then the brothers made an agreement
to kill their father for the sake of the gold. When this was done, Regin
demanded that Fafner should give him one half of it. Fafner answered
that there was but little hope that he
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>
<a name = "page196"> </a>
would share the gold with his brother, since he had himself slain his
father to obtain it; and he commanded Regin to get him gone, for else
the same thing would happen to him as had happened to Hreidmar. Fafner
had taken the sword hight Hrotte, and the helmet which had belonged to
his father, and the latter he had placed on his head. This was called
the Æger’s helmet, and it was a terror to all living to behold it. Regin
had the sword called Refil. With it he fled. But Fafner went to
Gnita-heath (the glittering heath), where he made himself a bed, took on
him the likeness of a serpent (dragon), and lay brooding over the
gold.</p>

<p>Regin then went to Thjode, to king Hjalprek, and became his smith.
There he undertook the fostering of Sigurd (Sigfrid), the son of
Sigmund, the son of Volsung and the son of Hjordis, the daughter of
Eylime. Sigurd was the mightiest of all the kings of hosts, in respect
to both family and power and mind. Regin explained to him where Fafner
was lying on the gold, and egged him on to try to get possession
thereof. Then Regin made the sword which is hight Gram (wrath), and
which was so sharp that when Sigurd held it in the flowing stream it cut
asunder a tuft of wool which the current carried down against the
sword’s edge. In the next place, Sigurd cut with his sword Regin’s anvil
in twain.
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197"> </a>
Thereupon Sigurd and Regin repaired to Gnita-heath. Here Sigurd dug a
ditch in Fafner’s path and sat down in it; so when Fafner crept to the
water and came directly over this ditch, Sigurd pierced him with the
sword, and this thrust caused his death. Then Regin came and declared
that Sigurd had slain his brother, and demanded of him as a ransom that
he should cut out Fafner’s heart and roast it on the fire; but Regin
kneeled down, drank Fafner’s blood, and laid himself down to sleep.
While Sigurd was roasting the heart, and thought that it must be done,
he touched it with his finger to see how tender it was; but the fat
oozed out of the heart and onto his finger and burnt it, so that he
thrust his finger into his mouth. The heart-blood came in contact with
his tongue, which made him comprehend the speech of birds, and he
understood what the eagles said that were sitting in the trees. One of
the birds said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
There sits Sigurd,<br>
Stained with blood.<br>
On the fire is roasting<br>
Fafner’s heart.<br>
Wise seemed to me<br>
The ring-destroyer,<br>

Heart would eat.
</p>

<p>Another eagle sang:</p>

<p class = "verse">

<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
<a name = "page198"> </a><br>

Of false accusations.<br>
The evil smith plots<br>
Revenge ’gainst the brother.<a class = "tag" name = "tag95" href =
"#note95">95</a>
</p>

<p>Then Sigurd went to Regin and slew him, and thereupon he mounted his
horse hight Grane, and rode until he came to Fafner’s bed, took out all
the gold, packed it in two bags and laid it on Grane’s back, then got on
himself and rode away. Now is told the saga according to which gold is
called Fafner’s bed or lair, the metal of Gnita-heath, or Grane’s
burden.</p>

<p>Then Sigurd rode on until he found a house on the mountain. In it
slept a woman clad in helmet and coat-of-mail. He drew his sword and cut
the coat-of-mail off from her. Then she awaked and called herself Hild.
Her name was Brynhild, and she was a valkyrie. Thence Sigurd rode on and
came to the king whose name was Gjuke. His wife was called Grimhild, and
their children were Gunnar, Hogne, Gudrun, Gudny; Gothorm was Gjuke’s
step-son. Here Sigurd remained a long time. Then he got the hand of
Gudrun, Gjuke’s daughter, and Gunnar and Hogne entered into a sworn
brotherhood with Sigurd. Afterward Sigurd and the sons of Gjuke went to
Atle, Budle’s son, to ask for his sister,
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<a name = "page199"> </a>
Brynhild, for Gunnar’s wife. She sat on Hindfell, and her hall was
surrounded by the bickering flame called the Vafurloge, and she had made
a solemn promise not to wed any other man than him who dared to ride
through the bickering flame. Then Sigurd and the Gjukungs (they are also
called Niflungs) rode upon the mountain, and there Gunnar was to ride
through the Vafurloge. He had the horse that was called Gote, but this
horse did not dare to run into the flame. So Sigurd and Gunnar changed
form and weapons, for Grane would not take a step under any other man
than Sigurd. Then Sigurd mounted Grane and rode through the bickering
flame. That same evening he held a wedding with Brynhild; but when they
went to bed he drew his sword Gram from the sheath and placed it between
them. In the morning when he had arisen, and had donned his clothes, he
gave to Brynhild, as a bridal gift, the gold ring that Loke had taken
from Andvare, and he received another ring as a memento from her. Then
Sigurd mounted his horse and rode to his companions. He and Gunnar
exchanged forms again and went back to Gjuke with Brynhild. Sigurd had
two children with Gudrun. Their names were Sigmund and Swanhild.</p>

<p>Once it happened that Brynhild and Gudrun went to the water to wash
their hair. When they came to the river Brynhild waded from the
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<a name = "page200"> </a>
river bank into the stream, and said that she could not bear to have
that water in her hair that ran from Gudrun’s hair, for she had a more
high-minded husband. Then Gudrun followed her into the stream, and said
that she was entitled to wash her hair farther up the stream than
Brynhild, for the reason that she had the husband who was bolder than
Gunnar, or any other man in the world; for it was he who slew Fafner and
Regin, and inherited the wealth of both. Then answered Brynhild: A
greater deed it was that Gunnar rode through the Vafurloge, which Sigurd
did not dare to do. Then laughed Gudrun and said: Do you think it was
Gunnar who rode through the bickering flame? Then I think you shared the
bed with him who gave me this gold ring. The gold ring which you have on
your finger, and which you received as a bridal-gift, is called
Andvaranaut (Andvare’s Gift), and I do not think Gunnar got it on
Gnita-heath. Then Brynhild became silent and went home. Thereupon she
egged Gunnar and Hogne to kill Sigurd; but being sworn brothers of
Sigurd, they egged Guthorm, their brother, to slay Sigurd. Guthorm
pierced him with his sword while he was sleeping; but as soon as Sigurd
was wounded he threw his sword, Gram, after Guthorm, so that it cut him
in twain through the middle. There Sigurd fell, and his
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201"> </a>
son, three winters old, by name Sigmund, whom they also killed. Then
Brynhild pierced herself with the sword and was cremated with Sigurd.
But Gunnar and Hogne inherited Fafner’s gold and the Gift of Andvare,
and now ruled the lands.</p>

<p>King Atle, Budle’s son, Brynhild’s brother, then got in marriage
Gudrun, who had been Sigurd’s wife, and they had children. King Atle
invited Gunnar and Hogne to visit him, and they accepted his invitation.
But before they started on their journey they concealed Fafner’s hoard
in the Rhine, and that gold has never since been found. King Atle had
gathered together an army and fought a battle with Gunnar and Hogne, and
they were captured. Atle had the heart cut out of Hogne alive. This was
his death. Gunnar he threw into a den of snakes, but a harp was secretly
brought to him, and he played the harp with his toes (for his hands were
fettered), so that all the snakes fell asleep excepting the adder, which
rushed at him and bit him in the breast, and then thrust its head into
the wound and clung to his liver until he died. Gunnar and Hogne are
called Niflungs (Niblungs) and Gjukungs. Hence gold is called the
Niflung treasure or inheritance. A little later Gudrun slew her two sons
and made from their skulls goblets trimmed with gold, and thereupon the
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202"> </a>
funeral ceremonies took place. At the feast, Gudrun poured for King Atle
in these goblets mead that was mixed with the blood of the youths. Their
hearts she roasted and gave to the king to eat. When this was done she
told him all about it, with many unkind words. There was no lack of
strong mead, so that the most of the people sitting there fell asleep.
On that night she went to the king when he had fallen asleep, and had
with her her son Hogne. They slew him, and thus he ended his life. Then
they set fire to the hall, and with it all the people who were in it
were burned. Then she went to the sea and sprang into the water to drown
herself; but she was carried across the fjord, and came to the land
which belonged to King Jonaker. When he saw her he took her home and
made her his wife. They had three children, whose names were Sorle,
Hamder and Erp. They all had hair as black as ravens, like Gunnar and
Hogne and the other Niflungs.</p>

<p>There was fostered Swanhild, the daughter of Sigurd, and she was the
fairest of all women. That Jormunrek, the rich, found out. He sent his
son, Randver, to ask for her hand for him; and when he came to Jonaker,
Swanhild was delivered to him, so that he might bring her to King
Jormunrek. Then said Bikke that it would be more fitting that Randver
should marry Swanhild,
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203"> </a>
he being young and she too, but Jormunrek being old. This plan pleased
the two young people well. Soon afterward Bikke informed the king of it,
and so King Jormunrek seized his son and had him brought to the gallows.
Then Randver took his hawk, plucked the feathers off him, and requested
that it should be sent to his father, whereupon he was hanged. But when
King Jormunrek saw the hawk, it came to his mind that as the hawk was
flightless and featherless, so his kingdom was without preservation; for
he was old and sonless. Then King Jormunrek riding out of the woods from
the chase with his courtiers, while Queen Swanhild sat dressing her
hair, had the courtiers ride onto her, and she was trampled to death
beneath the feet of the horses. When Gudrun heard of this, she begged
her sons to avenge Swanhild. While they were busking themselves for the
journey, she brought them byrnies and helmets, so strong that iron could
not scathe them. She laid the plan for them, that when they came to King
Jormunrek, they should attack him in the night whilst he was sleeping.
Sorle and Hamder should cut off his hands and feet, and Erp his head. On
the way they asked Erp what assistance they were to get from him, when
they came to King Jormunrek. He answered them that he would give them
such assistance as the hand gives the foot. They said
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204"> </a>
that the feet got no support from the hands whatsoever. They were angry
at their mother, because she had forced them to undertake this journey
with harsh words, and hence they were going to do that which would
displease her most. So they killed Erp, for she loved him the most. A
little later, while Sorle was walking, he slipped with one foot, and in
falling supported himself with his hands. Then said he: Now the hands
helped the foot; better were it now if Erp were living. When they came
to Jormunrek, the king, in the night, while he was sleeping, they cut
off both his hands and his feet. Then he awaked, called his men and bade
them arise. Said Hamder then: The head would now have been off had Erp
lived. The courtiers got up, attacked them, but could not overcome them
with weapons. Then Jormunrek cried to them that they should stone them
to death. This was done, Sorle and Hamder fell, and thus perished the
last descendants of Gjuke.</p>

<p>After King Sigurd lived a daughter hight Aslaug, who was fostered at
Heimer’s in Hlymdaler. From her mighty races are descended. It is said
that Sigmund, the son of Volsung, was so powerful, that he drank venom
and received no harm therefrom. But Sinfjotle, his son, and Sigurd, were
so hard-skinned that no venom coming
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205"> </a>
onto them could harm them. Therefore the skald Brage has sung as
follows:</p>

<p>Upon these sagas very many skalds have made lays, and from them they

<p>Why is gold called Frode’s meal? The saga giving rise to this is the
following:</p>

<p>Odin had a son by name Skjold, from whom the Skjoldungs are
descended. He had his throne and ruled in the lands that are now called
Denmark, but were then called Gotland. Skjold had a son by name
Fridleif, who ruled the lands after him. Fridleif’s son was Frode. He
took the kingdom after his father, at the time when the Emperor Augustus
established peace in all the earth and Christ was born. But Frode being
the mightiest king in the northlands, this peace was attributed to him
by all who spake the Danish tongue, and the Norsemen called it the
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207"> </a>
peace of Frode. No man injured the other, even though he might meet,
loose or in chains, his father’s or brother’s bane. There was no thief
or robber, so that a gold ring would be a long time on Jalanger’s heath.
King Frode sent messengers to Svithjod, to the king whose name was
Fjolner, and bought there two maid-servants, whose names were Fenja and
Menja. They were large and strong. About this time were found in Denmark
two mill-stones, so large that no one had the strength to turn them. But
the nature belonged to these mill-stones that they ground whatever was
demanded of them by the miller. The name of this mill was Grotte. But
the man to whom King Frode gave the mill was called Hengekjapt. King
Frode had the maid-servants led to the mill, and requested them to grind
for him gold and peace, and Frode’s happiness. Then he gave them no
longer time to rest or sleep than while the cuckoo was silent or while
they sang a song. It is said that they sang the song called the
Grottesong, and before they ended it they ground out a host against
Frode; so that on the same night there came the sea-king, whose name was
Mysing, and slew Frode and took a large amount of booty. Therewith the
Frode-peace ended. Mysing took with him Grotte, and also Fenja and
Menja, and bade them grind salt, and in the middle of the night they
asked Mysing
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208"> </a>
whether he did not have salt enough. He bade them grind more. They
ground only a short time longer before the ship sank. But in the ocean
arose a whirlpool (Maelstrom, mill-stream) in the place where the sea
runs into the mill-eye. Thus the sea became salt.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_rolf">ROLF KRAKE.</a></h5>

<p>A king in Denmark hight Rolf Krake, and was the most famous of all
kings of olden times; moreover, he was more mild, brave and
condescending than all other men. A proof of his condescension, which is
very often spoken of in olden stories, was the following: There was a
poor little fellow by name Vog. He once came into King Rolf’s hall while
the king was yet a young man, and of rather delicate growth. Then Vog
went before him and looked up at him. Then said the king: What do you
mean to say, my fellow, by looking so at me? Answered Vog: When I was at
home I heard people say that King Rolf, at Hleidra, was the greatest man
in the northlands, but now sits here in the high-seat a little crow
(krake), and it they call their king. Then made answer the king: You, my
fellow, have given me a name, and I shall henceforth be called Rolf
Krake, but it is customary that a gift accompanies the name. Seeing that
you have no gift that you can give me with the name, or that would be
suitable to me, then he who has must give to the other. Then he took a
gold ring off his hand and gave it to the churl. Then said Vog: You give
as the best king of all, and therefore I now pledge myself to become the
bane of
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215"> </a>
him who becomes your bane. Said the king, laughing: A small thing makes
Vog happy.</p>

<p>Another example is told of Rolf Krake’s bravery. In Upsala reigned a
king by name Adils, whose wife was Yrsa, Rolf Krake’s mother. He was
engaged in a war with Norway’s king, Ale. They fought a battle on the
ice of the lake called Wenern. King Adils sent a message to Rolf Krake,
his stepson, asking him to come and help him, and promising to furnish
pay for his whole army during the campaign. Furthermore King Rolf
himself should have any three treasures that he might choose in Sweden.
But Rolf Krake could not go to his assistance, on account of the war
which he was then waging against the Saxons. Still he sent twelve
berserks to King Adils. Among them were Bodvar Bjarke, Hjalte the
Valiant, Hvitserk the Keen, Vot, Vidsete, and the brothers Svipday and
Beigud. In that war fell King Ale and a large part of his army. Then
King Adils took from the dead King Ale the helmet called Hildesvin, and
his horse called Rafn. Then the berserks each demanded three pounds of
gold in pay for their service, and also asked for the treasures which
they had chosen for Rolf Krake, and which they now desired to bring to
him. These were the helmet Hildegolt; the byrnie Finnsleif, which no
steel could scathe; and the gold ring called Sviagris, which had
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216"> </a>
belonged to Adils’ forefathers. But the king refused to surrender any of
these treasures, nor did he give the berserks any pay. The berserks then
returned home, and were much dissatisfied. They reported all to King
Rolf, who straightway busked himself to fare against Upsala; and when he
came with his ships into the river Fyre, he rode against Upsala, and
with him his twelve berserks, all peaceless. Yrsa, his mother, received
him and took him to his lodgings, but not to the king’s hall. Large
fires were kindled for them, and ale was brought them to drink. Then
came King Adils’ men in and bore fuel onto the fireplace, and made a
fire so great that it burnt the clothes of Rolf and his berserks,
saying: Is it true that neither fire nor steel will put Rolf Krake and
his berserks to flight? Then Rolf Krake and all his men sprang up, and
he said:</p>

<p class = "verse">
Let us increase the blaze<br>
In Adils’ chambers.
</p>

<p>He took his shield and cast it into the fire, and sprang over the
fire while the shield was burning, and cried:</p>

<p class = "verse">
From the fire flees not he<br>
Who over it leaps.
</p>

<p>The same did also his men, one after the other, and then they took
those who had put fuel on the fire and cast them into it. Now Yrsa came
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217"> </a>
and handed Rolf Krake a deer’s horn full of gold, and with it she gave
him the ring Sviagris, and requested them to ride straightway to their
army. They sprang upon their horses and rode away over the Fyrisvold.
Then they saw that King Adils was riding after them with his whole army,
all armed, and was going to slay them. Rolf Krake took gold out of the
horn with his right hand, and scattered it over the whole way. But when
the Swedes saw it they leaped out of their saddles, and each one took as
much as he could. King Adils bade them ride, and he himself rode on with
all his might. The name of his horse was Slungner, the fastest of all
horses. When Rolf Krake saw that King Adils was riding near him, he took
the ring Sviagris and threw it to him, asking him to take it as a gift.
King Adils rode to the ring, picked it up with the end of his spear, and
let it slide down to his hand. Then Rolf Krake turned round and saw that
the other was stooping. Said he: Like a swine I have now bended the
foremost of all Swedes. Thus they parted. Hence gold is called the seed
of Krake or of Fyrisvold.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "poet_hogne">HOGNE AND HILD.</a></h5>

<p>A king by name Hogne had a daughter by name Hild. Her a king, by name
Hedin, son of Hjarrande, made a prisoner of war, while King Hogne had
fared to the trysting of the kings. But when he learned that there had
been harrying in his kingdom, and that his daughter had been taken away,
he rode with his army in search of Hedin, and learned that he had sailed
northward along the coast. When King Hogne came to Norway, he found out
that Hedin had sailed westward into the sea. Then Hogne sailed after him
to the Orkneys. And when he came to the island called Ha, then Hedin was
there before him with his host. Then Hild went to meet her father, and
offered him as a reconciliation from Hedin a necklace; but if he was not
willing to accept this, she said that Hedin was prepared for a battle,
and Hogne might expect no clemency from him. Hogne answered his daughter
harshly. When she returned to Hedin, she told him that Hogne would not
be reconciled, and bade him busk himself for the battle. And so both
parties did; they landed on the island and marshaled their hosts. Then
Hedin called to Hogne, his father-in-law, offering him a reconciliation
and much gold as a ransom. Hogne answered:
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219"> </a>
Too late do you offer to make peace with me, for now I have drawn the
sword Dainsleif, which was smithied by the dwarfs, and must be the death
of a man whenever it is drawn; its blows never miss the mark, and the
wounds made by it never heal. Said Hedin: You boast the sword, but not
the victory. That I call a good sword that is always faithful to its
master. Then they began the battle which is called the Hjadninga-vig
(the slaying of the Hedin<i>ians</i>); they fought the whole day, and in
the evening the kings fared back to their ships. But in the night Hild
went to the battlefield, and waked up with sorcery all the dead that had
fallen. The next day the kings went to the battlefield and fought, and
so did also all they who had fallen the day before. Thus the battle
continued from day to day; and all they who fell, and all the swords
that lay on the field of battle, and all the shields, became stone. But
as soon as day dawned all the dead arose again and fought, and all the
weapons became new again, and in songs it is said that the Hjadnings
will so continue until Ragnarok.</p>

<p>The Enea mentioned in the Foreword to Gylfe’s Fooling refers to the
settlement of western Europe, where Æneas is said to have founded a city
on the Tiber. Bergmann, however, in his Fascination de Gulfi,
page&nbsp;28, refers it to the Thracian town Ainos.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "notes_herikon">HERIKON.</a></h5>

<p>Herikon is undoubtedly a mutilated form for Erichthonios. The
genealogy here given corresponds with the one given in the Iliad, Book
20, 215.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "notes_historical">THE HISTORICAL
ODIN.</a></h5>

<p>The historical or anthropomorphized Odin, described in the Foreword
to the Fooling of Gylfe, becomes interesting when we compare it with
Snorre’s account of that hero in Heimskringla, and then compare both
accounts with the Roman traditions about Æneas. Of course the whole
story is only a myth; but we should remember that in the minds and
hearts of our ancestors it served every purpose of genuine history. Our
fathers accepted it in as good faith as any Christian ever believed in
the gospel of Christ, and so it had a similar influence in moulding the
social, religious, political and literary life of our ancestors. We
become interested in this legend as
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222"> </a>
much as if it were genuine history, on account of the influence it
wielded upon the minds and hearts of a race destined to act so great a
part in the social, religious and political drama of Europe. We look
into this and other ancestral myths, and see mirrored in them all that
we afterward find to be reliable history of the old Teutons. In the same
manner we are interested in the story told about Romulus and Remus,
about Mars and the wolf. This Roman myth is equally prophetic in
reference to the future career of Rome. The warlike Mars, the rapacity
of the wolf, and the fratricide Romulus, form a mirror in which we see
reflected the whole historical development of the Romans; so that the
story of Romulus is a vest-pocket edition of the history of Rome.</p>

<p>There are many points of resemblance between this old story of Odin
and the account that Virgil gives us of Æneas, the founder of the Latin
race; and it is believed that, while Virgil imitated Homer, he based his
poem upon a legend current among his countrymen. The Greeks in Virgil’s
poem are Pompey and the Romans in our Teutonic story. The Trojans
correspond to Mithridates and his allies. Æneas and Odin are identical.
Just as Odin, a heroic defender of Mithridates, after traversing various
unknown countries, finally reaches the north of Europe, organizes the
various Teutonic kingdoms, settles his sons upon the thrones of Germany,
England, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and instructs his people to gather
strength and courage, so as eventually to take revenge on the cursed
Romans; so Æneas, one of the most valiant defenders of Troy, after many
adventures in various lands, at length settles in Italy,
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223"> </a>
and becomes the founder of a race that in course of time is to wreak
vengeance upon the Greeks. The prophecy contained in the Roman legend
was fulfilled by Metellus and Mummius, in the years 147 and 146 before
Christ, when the Romans became the conquerors of Greece. The prophecy
contained in our Teutonic legend foreshadowed with no less unrelenting
necessity the downfall of proud Rome, when the Teutonic commander
Odoacer, in the year 476 after Christ, dethroned, not Romulus, brother
of Remus, but Romulus Augustulus, son of Orestes. Thus history repeats
itself. Roman history begins and ends with Romulus; and we fancy we can
see some connection between Od-in and Od-oacer. “As the twig is bent the
tree is inclined.”</p>

<p>It might be interesting to institute a similar comparison between our
Teutonic race-founder Odin and Ulysses, king of Ithaca, but the reader
will have to do this for himself.</p>

<p>In one respect our heroes differ. The fall of Troy and the wanderings
of Ulysses became the theme of two great epic poems among the Greeks.
The wanderings and adventures of Æneas, son of Anchises, were fashioned
into a lordly epic by Virgil for the Romans. But the much-traveled man,
the <span class = "greek" title =
"Greek: anêr polutropos (text reads ‘πολύθροπος/poluthropos’)">ἀνὴρ
πολύτροπος</span> the weapons and the hero, Odin, who, driven by the
norns, first came to Teutondom and to the Baltic shores, has not yet
been sung. This wonderful expedition of our race-founder, which, by
giving a historic cause to all the later hostilities and conflicts
between the Teutons and the Romans, might, as suggested by Gibbon,
supply the noble ground-work of an epic poem as thrilling as the Æneid
of Virgil, has not yet
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224"> </a>
been woven into a song for our race, and we give our readers this full
account of Odin from the Heimskringla in connection with the Foreword to
Gylfe’s Fooling, with the hope that among our readers there may be found
some descendant of Odin, whose skaldic wings are but just fledged for
the flights he hopes to take, who will take a draught, first from
Mimer’s gushing fountain, then from Suttung’s mead, brought by Odin to
Asgard, and consecrate himself and his talents to this legend with all
the ardor of his soul. For, as William Morris so beautifully says of the
Volsung Saga, this is the great story of the Teutonic race, and should
be to us what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks, and what the tale of
Æneas was to the Romans, to all our race first and afterward, when the
evolution of the world has made the Teutonic race nothing more than a
name of what it has been; a story, too, then, should it be to the races
that come after us, no less than the Iliad, and the Odyssey and the
Æneid have been to us.<a class = "tag" name = "tag101" href =
"#note101">101</a> We sincerely trust that we shall see Odin wrought
into a Teutonic epic, that will present in grand outline the contrast

Laing’s translation, with a few verbal alterations where such seemed
necessary.</p>

<p>It is said that the earth’s circle (Heimskringla), which the human
race inhabits, is torn across into many bights, so that great seas run

"#note110">110</a> but was formerly called Tanaquisl or Vanaquisl, and
which falls into the ocean at
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226"> </a>
the Black Sea. The country of the people on the Vanaquisl was called
Vanaland or Vanaheim, and the river separates the three parts of the
world, of which the easternmost is called Asia and the westernmost
Europe.</p>

<p>The country east of the Tanaquisl in Asia was called Asaland or
Asaheim, and the chief city in that land was called Asgard.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag111" href = "#note111">111</a> In that city was a chief
called Odin, and it was a great place for sacrifice. It was the custom
there that twelve temple-priests<a class = "tag" name = "tag112" href =
"#note112">112</a> should both direct the sacrifices and also judge the
people. They were called priests or masters, and all the people served
and obeyed them. Odin was a great and very far-traveled warrior, who
conquered many kingdoms, and so successful was he that in every battle
the victory was on his side. It was the belief of his people that
victory belonged to him in every battle. It was his custom when he sent
his men into battle, or on any expedition, that he first laid his hand
upon their heads, and called down a blessing upon them; and then they
believed their undertaking would be successful. His people also were
accustomed, whenever they fell into danger by land or sea, to call upon
his name; and they thought
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227"> </a>
that always they got comfort and aid by it, for where he was they
thought help was near. Often he went away so long that he passed many
seasons on his journeys.</p>

<p>Odin had two brothers, the one hight Ve, the other Vile,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag113" href = "#note113">113</a> and they governed the
kingdom when he was absent. It happened once when Odin had gone to a
great distance, and had been so long away that the people of Asia
doubted if he would ever return home, that his two brothers took it upon
themselves to divide his estate; but both of them took his wife Frigg to
themselves. Odin soon after returned home, and took his wife back.</p>

<p>Odin went out with a great army against the Vanaland people; but they
were well prepared, and defended their land, so that victory was
changeable, and they ravaged the lands of each other and did great
damage. They tired of this at last, and, on both sides appointing a
meeting for establishing peace, made a truce and exchanged hostages. The
Vanaland people sent their best men,&mdash;Njord the Rich and his son
Frey; the people of Asaland sent a man hight Hœner,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag114" href = "#note114">114</a> as he was a stout and very handsome
man, and with him they sent a man of great understanding, called Mimer;
and on the other side the Vanaland people sent the wisest man in their
community, who was called Quaser. Now when Hœner came to Vanaheim he was
immediately made a chief, and Mimer came to him with good counsel on all
occasions. But when Hœner stood in the Things, or other meetings, if
Mimer was not near him, and any difficult matter was
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228"> </a>
laid before him, he always answered in one way: Now let others give
their advice; so that the Vanaland people got a suspicion that the
Asaland people had deceived them in the exchange of men. They took
Mimer, therefore, and beheaded him, and sent his head to the Asaland
people. Odin took the head, smeared it with herbs, so that it should not
rot, and sang incantations over it. Thereby he gave it the power that it
spoke to him, and discovered to him many secrets.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag115" href = "#note115">115</a> Odin placed Njord and Frey as priests
of the sacrifices, and they became deities of the Asaland people.
Njord’s daughter, Freyja, was priestess of the sacrifices, and first
taught the Asaland people the magic art, as it was in use and fashion
among the Vanaland people. While Njord was with the Vanaland people he
had taken his own sister in marriage, for that was allowed by their law;
and their children were Frey and Freyja. But among the Asaland people it
was forbidden to come together in so near relationship.<a class = "tag"

<p>There goes a great mountain barrier from northeast to southwest,
which divides the Great Svithjod from other kingdoms. South of this

= "tag117" href = "#note117">117</a> But Odin, having foreknowledge and
magic-sight, knew that his posterity would come to settle and dwell in
the northern half of the world. In those times the Roman chiefs went
wide around the world, subduing to themselves all people; and on this
account many chiefs fled from their domains.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag118" href = "#note118">118</a> Odin set his brothers
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230"> </a>
Vile and Ve over Asgard, and he himself, with all the gods and a great
many other people, wandered out, first westward to Gardarike (Russia),
and then south to Saxland (Germany). He had many sons, and
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231"> </a>
after having subdued an extensive kingdom in Saxland he set his sons to
defend the country. He himself went northward to the sea, and took up
his abode in an island which is called Odinse (see note below), in
Funen. Then he sent Gefjun across the sound to the north to discover new
countries, and she came to King Gylfe, who gave her a ploughland. Then
she went to Jotunheim and bore four sons to a giant, and transformed
them into a yoke of oxen, and yoked them to a plough and broke out the
land into the ocean, right opposite to Odinse, which was called Seeland,
where she afterward settled and dwelt.<a class = "tag" name = "tag119"
href = "#note119">119</a> Skjold, a son of Odin, married her, and they
dwelt at Leidre.<a class = "tag" name = "tag120" href =

Laage.<a class = "tag" name = "tag121" href = "#note121">121</a> In the

</p>

<p>Now when Odin heard that things were in a prosperous condition in the
land to the east beside Gylfe,
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232"> </a>
he went thither, and Gylfe made a peace with him, for Gylfe thought he
had no strength to oppose the people of Asaland. Odin and Gylfe had many
tricks and enchantments against each other; but the Asaland people had
always the superiority. Odin took up his residence at the Malar lake, at
the place now called Sigtun.<a class = "tag" name = "tag123" href =
"#note123">123</a> There he erected a large temple, where there were
sacrifices according to the customs of the Asaland people. He
appropriated to himself the whole of that district of country, and
called it Sigtun. To the temple gods he gave also domains. Njord dwelt
in Noatun, Frey in Upsal, Heimdal in Himinbjorg, Thor in Thrudvang,
Balder in Breidablik;<a class = "tag" name = "tag124" href =
"#note124">124</a> to all of them he gave good domains.</p>

<p>When Odin of Asaland came to the north, and the gods with him, he
began to exercise and to teach others the arts which the people long
afterward have practiced. Odin was the cleverest of all, and from him
all others learned their magic arts; and he knew them first, and knew
many more than other people. But now, to tell why he is held in such
high respect, we must mention various causes that contributed to it.
When sitting among his friends his countenance was so beautiful and
friendly, that the spirits of all were exhilarated by it; but when he
was in war, he appeared fierce and dreadful. This arose from his being
able to
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233"> </a>
change his color and form in any way he liked. Another cause was, that
he conversed so cleverly and smoothly, that all who heard were
persuaded. He spoke everything in rhyme, such as is now composed, and
which we call skald-craft. He and his temple gods were called
song-smiths, for from them came that art of song into the northern
countries. Odin could make his enemies in battle blind or deaf, or
terror-struck, and their weapons so blunt that they could no more cut
than a willow-twig; on the other hand, his men rushed forward without
armor, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were strong
as bears or wild bulls, and killed people at a blow, and neither fire
nor iron told upon them. These were called berserks.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag125" href = "#note125">125</a></p>

<p>Odin could transform his shape; his body would lie as if dead or
asleep, but then he would be in the shape of a fish, or worm, or bird,
or beast, and be off
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234"> </a>
in a twinkling to distant lands upon his own or other peoples’ business.
With words alone he could quench fire, still the ocean in tempest, and
turn the wind to any quarter he pleased. Odin had a ship, which he
called Skidbladner,<a class = "tag" name = "tag126" href =
"#note126">126</a> in which he sailed over wide seas, and which he could
roll up like a cloth. Odin carried with him Mimer’s head, which told him
all the news of other countries. Sometimes even he called the dead out
of the earth, or set himself beside the burial-mounds; whence he was
called the ghost-sovereign, and the lord of the mounds. He had two
ravens,<a class = "tag" name = "tag127" href = "#note127">127</a> to
whom he had taught the speech of man; and they flew far and wide through
the land, and brought him the news. In all such things he was
preëminently wise. He taught all these arts in runes and songs, which
are called incantations, and therefore the Asaland people are called
incantation-smiths. Odin also understood the art in which the greatest
power is lodged, and which he himself practiced, namely, what is called
magic. By means of this he could know beforehand the predestined fate<a
class = "tag" name = "tag128" href = "#note128">128</a> of men, or their
not yet completed lot, and also bring on the death, ill-luck or bad
health of people, or take away the strength or wit from one person and
give it to another. But after such witchcraft followed such
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235"> </a>
weakness and anxiety, that it was not thought respectable for men to
practice it; and therefore the priestesses were brought up in this art.
Odin knew definitely where all missing cattle were concealed under the
earth, and understood the songs by which the earth, the hills, the
stones and mounds were opened to him; and he bound those who dwell in
them by the power of his word, and went in and took what he pleased.
From these arts he became very celebrated. His enemies dreaded him; his
friends put their trust in him, and relied on his power and on himself.
He taught the most of his arts to his priests of the sacrifices, and
they came nearest to himself in all wisdom and witch-knowledge. Many
others, however, occupied themselves much with it; and from that time
witchcraft spread far and wide, and continued long. People sacrificed to
Odin, and the twelve chiefs of Asaland,&mdash;called them their gods,
and believed in them long after. From Odin’s name came the name Audun,
which people gave to his sons; and from Thor’s name came Thorer, also
Thorarinn; and it was also sometimes augmented by other additions, as
Steinthor, Hafthor, and many kinds of alterations.</p>

<p>Odin established the same law in his land that had been before in
Asaland. Thus he established by law that all dead men should be burned,
and their property laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be cast
into the sea or buried in the earth. Thus, said he, everyone will come
to Valhal with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he would
also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth. For men of
consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other
warriors who had been
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236"> </a>
distinguished for manhood, a standing stone; which custom remained long
after Odin’s time. Toward winter there should be a blood-sacrifice for a
good year, and in the middle of winter for a good crop; and the third
sacrifice should be in summer, for victory in battle. Over all
Svithjod<a class = "tag" name = "tag129" href = "#note129">129</a> the
people paid Odin a scatt, or tax,&mdash;so much on each head; but he had
to defend the country from enemy or disturbance, and pay the expense of
the sacrifice-feasts toward winter for a good year.</p>

<p>Njord took a wife hight Skade; but she would not live with him, but
married afterward Odin, and had many sons by him, of whom one was called
Saming, and of this Eyvind Skaldespiller sings thus:</p>

<p class = "verse">
To Asason<a class = "tag" name = "tag130" href = "#note130">130</a>
Queen Skade bore<br>
Saming, who dyed his shield in gore,&mdash;<br>
The giant queen of rock and snow<br>
Who loves to dwell on earth below,<br>
The iron pine-tree’s daughter she,<br>
Sprung from the rocks that rib the sea,<br>
To Odin bore full many a son,&mdash;<br>
Heroes of many a battle won.
</p>

<p>To Saming Jarl Hakon the Great reckoned up his pedigree.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag131" href = "#note131">131</a> This Svithjod (Sweden)
they call Mannheim, but the great Svithjod they call Godheim, and of
Godheim great wonders and novelties were related.</p>

<p>Odin died in his bed in Sweden; and when he was near his death he
made himself be marked with the point of a spear,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag132" href = "#note132">132</a> and said he was going to Godheim,
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<a name = "page237"> </a>
and would give a welcome there to all his friends, and all brave
warriors should be dedicated to him; and the Swedes believed that he was
gone to the ancient Asgard, and would live there eternally. Then began
the belief in Odin, and the calling upon him. The Swedes believed that
he often showed himself to them before any great battle. To some he gave
victory, others he invited to himself; and they reckoned both of these
to be well off in their fate. Odin was burnt, and at his pile there was
great splendor. It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in
the air, the higher would he be raised whose pile it was; and the richer
he would be the more property that was consumed with&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>Njord of Noatun was then the sole sovereign of the Swedes; and he
continued the sacrifices, and was called the drot, or sovereign, by the
Swedes, and he received scatt and gifts from them. In his days were
peace and plenty, and such good years in all respects that the Swedes
believed Njord ruled over the growth of seasons and the prosperity of
the people. In his time all the diars, or gods, died, and
blood-sacrifices were made for them. Njord died on a bed of sickness,
and before he died made himself be marked for Odin with the spear-point.
The Swedes burned him, and all wept over his grave-mound.</p>

<p>Frey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the Swedes,
and they paid taxes to him. He was like his father, fortunate in friends
and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Upsala, made it his
chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land and goods. Then began
the Upsala domains, which have remained ever since. Then began in his
day the
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238"> </a>
Frode-peace; and then there were good seasons in all the land, which the
Swedes ascribed to Frey, so that he was more worshiped than the other
gods, as the people became much richer in his days by reason of the
peace and good seasons. His wife was called Gerd, daughter of Gymer, and
their son was called Fjolner. Frey was called by another name, Yngve;
and this name Yngve was considered long after in his race as a name of
honor, so that his descendants have since been called Ynglings
(<i>i.e.</i> Yngve-lings). Frey fell into a sickness, and as his illness
took the upper hand, his men took the plan of letting few approach him.
In the meantime they raised a great mound, in which they placed a door
with three holes in it. Now when Frey died they bore him secretly into
the mound, but told the Swedes he was alive, and they kept watch over
him for three years. They brought all the taxes into the mound, and
through the one hole they put in the gold, through the other the silver,
and through the third the copper money that was paid. Peace and good
seasons continued.</p>

<p>Freyja alone remained of the gods, and she became on this account so
celebrated that all women of distinction were called by her name, whence
they now have the title Frue (Germ. <i>Frau</i>), so that every woman is
called frue (that is, mistress) over her property, and the wife is
called the house-frue. Freyja continued the blood-sacrifices. Freyja had
also many other names. Her husband was called Oder, and her daughters
Hnos and Gersame. They were so very beautiful that afterward the most
precious jewels were called by their names.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239"> </a>
When it became known to the Swedes that Frey was dead, and yet peace and
good seasons continued, they believed that it must be so as long as Frey
remained in Sweden, and therefore they would not burn his remains, but
called him the god of this world, and afterward offered continually
blood-sacrifices to him, principally for peace and good seasons.<a class

SETTLEMENT OF NORWAY.</a></h5>

<p>In the asa-faith we find various foreign elements introduced. Thus,
for example, the vans did not originally belong to the Odinic system. As
the Teutons came in contact with other races, the religious ideas of the
latter were frequently adopted in some modified form. Especially do
Finnish elements enter into the asa-system. The Finnish god of thunder
was Ukko. He is supposed to have been confounded with our Thor, whence
the latter got the name Öku-Thor (Ukko-Thor). The vans may be connected
with the Finnish Wainamoinen, and in the same manner a number of Celtic
elements have been mixed with Teutonic mythology. And this is not all.
There must have flourished a religious system in the North before the
arrival of Odin and
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240"> </a>
his apostles. This was probably either Tshudic or Celtic, or a mixture
of the two. The asa-doctrine superseded it, but there still remain
traces in some of the oldest records of the North. Thus we have in the
prehistoric sagas of Iceland an account of the finding of Norway,
wherein it is related that Fornjot,<a class = "tag" name = "tag134" href
= "#note134">134</a> in Jotland, which is also called Finland or
Quenland, east of the Gulf of Bothnia, had three sons: Hler, also called
Æger, Loge and Kare.<a class = "tag" name = "tag135" href =
"#note135">135</a> Of Loge it is related that he was of giant descent,
and, being very tall of stature, he was called Haloge, that is High
Loge; and after him the northern part of Norway is called Halogaland
(now Helgeland). He was married to Glod (a&nbsp;red-hot coal), and had
with her two daughters, Eysa and Eimyrja; both words meaning glowing
embers. Haloge had two jarls, Vifil (the one taking a vif = wife) and
Vesete (the one who sits at the ve = the sanctuary, that is, the dweller
by the hearth, the first sanctuary), who courted his daughters; the
former addressing himself to Eimyrja, the latter to Eysa, but the king
refusing to give his consent, they carried them away secretly. Vesete
settled in Borgundarholm (Bornholm), and had a son, Bue (one who settles
on a farm); Vifil sailed further east and settled on the island
Vifilsey, on the coast of Sweden, and had a son, Viking (the
pirate).</p>

<p>The third son, Kare, had a numerous offspring. He had one son by name
Jokul (iceberg), another Froste
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241"> </a>
(frost), and Froste’s son was named Sna (snow). He had a third son, by
name Thorri (bare frost), after whom the mid-winter month, Thorra-month,
was called; and his daughters hight Fonn (packed snow), Drifa
(snow-drift), and Mjoll (meal, fine snow). All these correspond well to
Kare’s name, which, as stated, means wind. Thorri had two sons, Nor and
Gor, and a daughter, Goe. The story goes on to tell how Goe, the sister,
was lost, and how the brothers went to search for her, until they
finally found him who had robbed her. He was Hrolf, from the mountain, a
son of the giant Svade, and a grandson of Asa-Thor. They settled their
trouble, and thereupon Hrolf married Goe, and Nor married Hrolf’s
sister, settled in the land and called it after his own name, Norvegr,
that is, Norway. By this story we are reminded of Kadmos, who went to
seek his lost sister Europa. In the Younger Edda the winds are called
the sons of Fornjot, the sea is called the son of Fornjot, and the
brother of the fire and of the winds, and Fornjot is named among the old
giants. This makes it clear that Fornjot and his offspring are not
historical persons, but cosmological impersonations. And additional
proof of this is found by an examination of the beginning of the Saga of
Thorstein, Viking’s Son. (See Viking Tales of the North, pp. 1
and&nbsp;2).</p>

<h6>CHAPTER I.</h6>

<p>This story about the ploughing of Gylfe reminds us of the legend told
in the first book of Virgil’s Æneid, about the founding of Carthage by
Dido, who bought from the Libyan king as much ground as she could cover
with a bull’s hide. Elsewhere it is related that she cut the bull’s hide
into narrow strips and encircled therewith all the ground upon which
Carthage was afterward built. Thus Dido deceived the Libyan king nearly
as effectually as Gefjun deluded King Gylfe. The story is also told by
Snorre in Heimskringla, see p.&nbsp;231.</p>

<p>The passage in verse, which has given translators so much trouble in
a transposed form, would read as follows: Gefjun glad drew that
excellent land (djúpródul = the deep sun = gold; öðla = udal = property;
djúpródul öðla = the golden property), Denmark’s increase (Seeland), so
that it reeked (steamed) from the running oxen. The oxen bore four heads
and eight eyes, as they went before the wide piece of robbed land of the
isle so rich in grass.</p>

<p>Gefjun is usually interpreted as a goddess of agriculture, and her
name is by some derived from <span class = "greek" title =
"Greek: gê">γῆ</span>; and <i>fjon</i>, that is, <i>terræ separatio</i>;
others compare it with the Anglo-Saxon <i>geofon</i> = the sea. The
etymology remains very uncertain.</p>

read: Reflecting men let shields (literally Svafner’s, that is Odin’s

shields glisten on the back, is said of men who throw their shields on
their backs to protect themselves against those who pursue the flying
host.</p>

<p>Har means the High One, Jafnhar the Equally High One, and Thride the
Third One. By these three may be meant the three chief gods of the
North: Odin, Thor and Frey; or they may be simply an expression of the
Eddic trinity. This trinity is represented in a number of ways: by Odin,
Vile and Ve in the creation of the world, and by Odin, Hœner and Loder
in the creation of Ask and Embla, the first human pair. The number three
figures extensively in all mythological systems. In the pre-chaotic
state we have Muspelheim, Niflheim and Ginungagap. Fornjot had three
sons: Hler, Loge and Kare. There are three norns: Urd, Verdande and
Skuld. There are three fountains: Hvergelmer, Urd’s and Mimer’s; etc.

<h6>CHAPTER III.</h6>

<p>This chapter gives twelve names of Odin. In the Eddas and in the
skaldic lays he has in all nearly two hundred names. His most common
name is Odin (in&nbsp;Anglo-Saxon and in Old High German <i>Wodan</i>),
and this is thought by many to be of the same origin as our word
<i>god</i>. The other Old Norse word for god, <i>tivi</i>, is identical
in root with Lat. <i>divus</i>; Sansk. <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original: ‘dyaus’?"><i>dwas</i></ins>; Gr. <span class = "greek"
title = "Greek: Dios (Zeus)">Διός (Ζεύς)</span>; and this is again
connected with <i>Tyr</i>, the Tivisco in the Germania of Tacitus. (See
Max Müller’s Lectures on the Science of Language, 2d series,
p.&nbsp;425). Paulus Diakonus states that Wodan, or Gwodan, was
worshiped by all branches of the Teutons. Odin has also been sought and
found in the Scythian <i>Zalmoxis</i>, in the Indian <i>Buddha</i>, in
the Celtic Budd, and in the Mexican Votan. Zalmoxis, derived from the
Gr. <span class = "greek" title = "Greek: Zalmos">Ζαλμός</span>,<a class
= "tag" name = "trans_tagA" href = "#trans_noteA">A</a> helmet, reminds
us of Odin as the helmet-bearer (Grimm, Gesch. der Deutschen Sprache).
According to Humboldt, a race in Guatemala, Mexico, claim to be
descended from Votan (Vues des Cordillères, 1817, I, 208). This suggests
the question whether Odin’s name may not have been brought to America by
the Norse discoverers in the 10th and 11th centuries, and adopted by
some of the native races. In the Lay of Grimner (Elder Edda) the
following names of Odin are enumerated:</p>

<p>What the etymology of all these names is, it is not easy to tell. The
most of them are clearly Norse words, and express the various activities
of their owner. It is worthy of notice that it is added when and where
Odin bore this or that name (his name was Grim at Geirrod’s, Jalk at
Asmund’s, etc.), and that the words sometimes indicate a progressive
development, as Thund, then Ygg, and then Odin. First he was a mere
sound in the air (Thund), then he took to thinking (Ygg), and at last he
became the inspiring soul of the universe. Although we are unable to
define all these names, they certainly each have a distinct meaning, and
our ancestors certainly understood them perfectly. Har = the High One;
Jafn-har = the Equally High One; Thride = the Third (<span class =
"greek" title = "Greek: Zeus allos">Ζεὺς ἄλλος</span> and <span class =
"greek" title = "Greek: Tritos">Τρίτος</span>; Alfather probably
contracted from <i>Alda</i>father = the Father of the Ages and the
Creations; Veratyr = the Lord of Beings; Rögner = the Ruler (from
regin); Got (Gautr, from <i>gjóta</i>, to cast) = the Creator, Lat.
Instillator; Mjotud = the Creator, the word being allied to Anglo-Saxon
<i>meotod</i>, <i>metod</i>, Germ. <i>Messer</i>, and means originally
cutter; but to cut and to make are synonymous. Such names as these have
reference to Odin’s divinity as creator, arranger and ruler of gods and
men. Svid and Fjolsvid
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247"> </a>
= the swift, the wise; Ganglere, Gangrad and Vegtam = the wanderer, the
waywont; Vidrer = the weather-ruler, together with serpent-names like
Ofner, Svafner, etc., refer to Odin’s knowledge, his journeys, the
various shapes he assumes. Permeating all nature, he appears in all its
forms. Names like Sidhot = the slouchy hat; Sidskeg = the long-beard;
Baleyg = the burning-eye; Grimner = the masked; Jalk (Jack) = the youth,
etc., express the various forms in which he was thought to
appear,&mdash;to his slouchy hat, his long beard, or his age, etc. Such
names as Sanngetal = the true investigator; Farmatyr = the cargo-god,
etc., refer to his various occupations as inventor, discoverer of runes,
protector of trade and commerce, etc. Finally, all such names as
Herfather = father of hosts; Herjan = the devastator; Sigfather = the
father of victory; Sigtyr = god of victory; Skilfing = producing
trembling; Hnikar = the breaker, etc., represent Odin as the god of war
and victory. Oske = wish, is thus called because he gratifies our
desires. Gimle, as will be seen later, is the abode of the blessed after
Ragnarok. Vingolf (Vin and golf) means <i>friends’ floor</i>, and is the
hall of the goddesses. Hel is the goddess of death, and from her name
our word <i>hell</i> is derived.</p>

<p>Our ancestors divided the universe into nine worlds: the uppermost
was Muspelheim (the world of light); the lowest was Niflheim (the world
of darkness). Compare the Greek word <span class = "greek" title =
"Greek: nephelê (text reads ‘νεφέλγ/nephelg’)">νεφέλη</span> = mist.
(See Norse Mythology, p.&nbsp;187.)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Ginungagap.</span> Ginn means wide, large,
far-reaching, perhaps also void (compare the Anglo-Saxon <i>gin</i> =
gaping, open, spacious; ginian = to gap; and ginnung
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<a name = "page248"> </a>
= a yawning). Ginungagap thus means the yawning gap or abyss, and
represents empty space. The poets use ginnung in the sense of a fish and
of a hawk, and in geographical saga-fragments it is used as the name of
the Polar&nbsp;Sea.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Hvergelmer.</span> This word is usually
explained as a transposition for Hvergemler, which would then be derived
from Hver and gamall (old) = the old kettle; but Petersen shows that
gelmir must be taken from galm, which is still found in the Jutland
dialect, and means a gale (compare Golmstead = a windy place, and
<i>golme</i> = to roar, blow). Gelmer is then the one producing galm,
and Hvergelmer thus means the roaring kettle. The twelve rivers
proceeding from Hvergelmer are called the Elivogs (Élivágar) in the next
chapter. Éli-vágar means, according to Vigfusson, ice-waves. The most of
the names occur in the long list of river names given in the Lay of
Grimner, of the Elder Edda. Svol = the cool; Gunnthro = the
battle-trough. Slid is also mentioned in the Vala’s Prophecy, where it
is represented as being full of mud and swords. Sylg (from
<i>svelgja</i> = to swallow) = the devourer; Ylg (from <i>yla</i> = to
roar) = the roaring one; Leipt = the glowing, is also mentioned in the
Lay of Helge Hunding’s Bane, where it is stated that they swore by it
(compare Styx); Gjoll (from <i>gjalla</i> = to glisten and clang) = the
shining, clanging one. The meaning of the other words is not clear, but
they doubtless all, like those explained, express cold, violent motion,
etc. The most noteworthy of these rivers are Leipt and Gjoll. In the Lay
of Grimner they are said to flow nearest to the abode of man, and fall
thence into Hel’s realm. Over Gjoll was
<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
<a name = "page249"> </a>
the bridge which Hermod, after the death of Balder, crossed on his way
to Hel. It is said to be thatched with shining gold, and a maid by name
Modgud watches it. In the song of Sturle Thordson, on the death of Skule
Jarl, it is said that “the king’s kinsman went over the Gjoll-bridge.”
The farther part of the horizon, which often appears like a broad bright
stream, may have suggested this river.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Surt</span> means the swarthy or black one.
Many have regarded him as the unknown (dark) god, but this is probably
an error. But there was some one in Muspelheim who sent the heat, and
gave life to the frozen drops of rime. The latter, and not Surt, who is
a giant, is the eternal god, the mighty one, whom the skald in the Lay
of Hyndla dare not name. It is interesting to notice that our ancestors
divided the evolution of the world into three distinct periods:
(1)&nbsp;a pre-chaotic condition (Niflheim, Muspelheim and Ginungagap);
(2)&nbsp;a chaotic condition (Ymer and the cow Audhumbla); (3)&nbsp;and
finally the three gods, Odin (spirit), Vile (will) and Ve (sanctity),
transformed chaos into cosmos. And away back in this pre-chaotic state
of the world we find this mighty being who sends the heat. It is not
definitely stated, but it can be inferred from other passages, that just
as the good principle existed from everlasting in Muspelheim, so the
evil principle existed co-eternally with it in Hvergelmer in Niflheim.
Hvergelmer is the source out of which all matter first proceeded, and
the dragon or devil Nidhug, who dwells in Hvergelmer, is, in our
opinion, the evil principle who is from eternity. The good principle
shall continue forever, but the evil shall cease to exist after
Ragnarok.</p>

<p>While the etymology of the names in the myths are very obscure, the
myths themselves are clear enough. Similar myths abound in Greek
mythology. The story about Bil and Hjuke is our old English rhyme about
Jack and Gill, who went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.</p>


<h6>CHAPTER V.</h6>

<p>In reference to the golden age, see Norse Mythology, pp. 182 and
197.</p>

<p>In the appendix to the German so-called Hero-Book we are told that
the dwarfs were first created
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251"> </a>
to cultivate the desert lands and the mountains; thereupon the giants,
to subdue the wild beasts; and finally the heroes, to assist the dwarfs
against the treacherous giants. While the giants are always hostile to
the gods, the dwarfs are usually friendly to them.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dwarfs.</span> Both giants and dwarfs shun
the light. If surprised by the breaking forth of day, they become
changed to stone. In one of the poems of the Elder Edda (the Alvismál),
Thor amuses the dwarf Alvis with various questions till daylight, and
then <ins class = "correction" title = "so in original">cooly</ins>
says to him: With great artifices, I tell you, you have been
deceived; you are surprised here, dwarf, by daylight! The sun now shines
in the hall. In the Helgakvida Atle says to the giantess Hrimgerd: It is
now day, Hrimgerd! But Atle has detained you, to your life’s perdition.
It will appear a laughable harbor-mark, where you stand as a
stone-image.</p>

<p>In the German tales the dwarfs are described as deformed and
diminutive, coarsely clad and of dusky hue: “a little black man,” “a
little gray man.” They are sometimes of the height of a child of four
years, sometimes as two spans high, a thumb high (hence, Tom Thumb). The
old Danish ballad of Eline of Villenwood mentions a troll not bigger
than an ant. Dvergmál (the speech of the dwarfs) is the Old Norse
expression for the echo in the mountains.</p>

<p>In the later popular belief, the dwarfs are generally called the
subterraneans, the brown men in the moor, etc. They make themselves
invisible by a hat or hood. The women spin and weave, the men are
smiths. In Norway rock-crystal is called dwarf-stone. Certain
<span class = "pagenum">252</span>
<a name = "page252"> </a>
stones are in Denmark called dwarf-hammers. They borrow things and seek
advice from people, and beg aid for their wives when in labor, all which
services they reward. But they also lame cattle, are thievish, and will
carry off damsels. There have been instances of dwarf females having
married and had children with men. (Thorpe’s Northern Mythology.)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">War.</span> It was the first warfare in the
world, says the Elder Edda, when they pierced Gullveig (gold-thirst)
through with a spear, and burned her in Odin’s hall. Thrice they burned
her, thrice she was born anew: again and again, but still she lives.
When she comes to a house they call her Heide (the bright, the welcome),
and regard her as a propitious vala or prophetess. She can tame wolves,
understands witchcraft, and delights wicked women. Hereupon the gods
consulted together whether they should punish this misdeed, or accept a
blood-fine, when Odin cast forth a spear among mankind, and now began
war and slaughter in the world. The defenses of the burgh of the asas
was broken down. The vans anticipated war, and hastened over the field.
The valkyries came from afar, ready to ride to the gods’ people: Skuld
with the shield, Skogul, Gunn, Hild, Gondul and Geirr Skogul. (Quoted by
Thorpe.)</p>


<h6>CHAPTER VI.</h6>

<p>In reference to Ygdrasil, we refer our readers to Norse Mythology,
pp. 205-211, and to Thomas Carlyle’s Heroes and Hero-worship.</p>

<p>A connection between the norns Urd, Verdande and Skuld and the weird
sisters in Shakspeare’s <i>Macbeth</i> has long since been recognized;
but new light has
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253"> </a>
recently been thrown upon the subject by the philosopher Karl Blind, who
has contributed valuable articles on the subject in the German
periodical “Die Gegenwart” and in the “London Academy.” We take the
liberty of reproducing here an abstract of his article in the
“Academy”:</p>

<div class = "longquote">
<p class = "aster">* * * * * *</p>

<p>The fact itself of these Witches being simply transfigurations, or
later disguises, of the Teutonic Norns is fully established&mdash;as may
be seen from Grimm or Simrock. In delineating these hags, Shakspeare has
practically drawn upon old Germanic sources, perhaps upon current
folk-lore of his time.</p>

<p>It has always struck me as noteworthy that in the greater part of the
scene between the Weird Sisters, Macbeth and Banquo, and wherever the
Witches come in, Shakspeare uses the staff-rime in a remarkable manner.
Not only does this add powerfully to the archaic impressiveness and awe,
but it also seems to bring the form and figure of the Sisters of Fate
more closely within the circle of the Teutonic idea. I have pointed out
this striking use of the alliterative system in <i>Macbeth</i> in an
article on “An old German Poem and a Vedic Hymn,” which appeared in
<i>Fraser</i> in June, 1877, and in which the derivation of the Weird
Sisters from the Germanic Norns is mentioned.</p>

<p>The very first scene in the first act of <i>Macbeth</i> opens
strongly with the staff-rime:</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>1st Witch</i>. When shall we three meet again&mdash;<br>
In thunder, lightning or in rain?</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>2d Witch</i>. When the hurly-burly’s done,<br>
When the battle’s lost and won.</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>3d Witch</i>. That will be ere set of sun.</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>1st Witch</i>. Where the place?</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>2d Witch</i>.<span class = "inset">Upon the heath.</span></p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>3d Witch</i>. There to meet with Macbeth.</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>1st Witch</i>. I come, Graymalkin!</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>All</i>. Paddock calls. Anon.<br>
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.<br>
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
</p>

<p>Not less marked is the adoption of the fullest
staff-rime&mdash;together (as&nbsp;above) with the end-rime&mdash;in the
third scene, when the Weird Sisters speak. Again, there is the
staff-rime when Banquo addresses them. Again, the strongest
alliteration, combined with the
<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254"> </a>
end-rime, runs all through the Witches’ spell-song in Act iv, scene 1.
This feature in Shakspeare appears to me to merit closer investigation;
all the more so because a less regular alliteration, but still a marked
one, is found in not a few passages of a number of his plays. Only one
further instance of the systematic employment of alliteration may here
be noted in passing. It is in Ariel’s songs in the <i>Tempest</i>, Act
i, scene 2. Schlegel and Tieck evidently did not observe this
alliterative peculiarity. Their otherwise excellent translation does not
render it, except so far as the obvious similarity of certain English
and German words involuntarily made them do so. But in the notes to
their version of <i>Macbeth</i> the character of the Weird Sisters is
also misunderstood, though Warburton is referred to, who had already
suggested their derivations from the Valkyrs or Norns.</p>

<p>It is an error to say that the Witches in <i>Macbeth</i> “are never
called witches” (compare Act i, scene 3: “‘Give me!’ quoth I. ‘A-roint
thee, <i>witch</i>!’ the rump-fed ronyon cries”). However, their
designation as Weird Sisters fully settles the case of their Germanic
origin.</p>

<p>This name “Weird” is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Norn Wyrd (Sax.
<i>Wurth</i>; O. H. Ger. <i>Wurd</i>; Norse, <i>Urd</i>), who represents
the Past, as her very name shows. Wurd is <i>die Gewordene</i>&mdash;the
“Has Been,” or rather the “Has Become,” if one could say so in
English.</p>

<p class = "aster">* * * * * *</p>

<p>In Shakspeare the Witches are three in number&mdash;even as in Norse,
German, as well as in Keltic and other mythologies. Urd, properly
speaking, is the Past. Skuld is the Future, or “That Which shall Be.”
Verdandi, usually translated as the Present, has an even deeper meaning.
Her name is not to be derived from <i>vera</i> (to&nbsp;be), but from
<i>verda</i> (Ger. <i>werden</i>). This verb, which has a mixed meaning
of “to be,” “to become,” or to “grow,” has been lost in English.
Verdandi is, therefore, not merely a representative of present Being,
but of the process of Growing, or of Evolution&mdash;which gives her
figure a profounder aspect. Indeed, there is generally more significance
in mythological tales than those imagine who look upon them chiefly as a
barren play of fancy.</p>

<p>Incidentally it may be remarked that, though Shakspeare’s Weird
Sisters are three in number&mdash;corresponding to Urd, Verdandi and
Skuld&mdash;German and Northern mythology and folk-lore occasionally
speak of twelve or seven of them. In the German tale of
<i>Dornröschen</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255"> </a>
or the Sleeping Beauty, there are twelve good fays; and a thirteenth,
who works the evil spell. Once, in German folk-lore, we meet with but
two Sisters of Fate&mdash;one of them called <i>Kann</i>, the other
<i>Muss</i>. Perhaps these are representatives of man’s measure of free
will (that which he “can”), and of that which is his inevitable
fate&mdash;or, that which he “must”&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>Though the word “Norn” has been lost in England and Germany, it is
possibly preserved in a German folk-lore ditty, which speaks of three
Sisters of Fate as “Nuns.” Altogether, German folk-lore is still full of
rimes about three Weird Sisters. They are sometimes called Wild Women,
or Wise Women, or the Measurers (<i>Metten</i>)&mdash;namely, of Fate;
or, euphemistically, like the Eumenides, the Advisers of Welfare
(<i>Heil-Räthinnen</i>), reminding us of the counsels given to Macbeth
in the apparition scene; or the Quick Judges (<i>Gach-Schepfen</i>).
Even as in the Edda, these German fays weave and twist threads or ropes,
and attach them to distant parts, thus fixing the weft of Fate. One of
these fays is sometimes called Held, and described as black, or as half
dark half white&mdash;like Hel, the Mistress of the Nether World. That
German fay is also called Rachel, clearly a contraction of Rach-Hel,
i.e. the Avengeress&nbsp;Hel.</p>

<p>Now, in <i>Macbeth</i> also the Weird Sisters are described as
“black.” The coming up of Hekate with them in the cave-scene might not
unfitly be looked upon as a parallel with the German Held, or Rach-Hel,
and the Norse Hel; these Teutonic deities being originally Goddesses of
Nocturnal Darkness, and of the Nether World, even as Hekate.</p>

<p>In German folk-lore, three Sisters of Fate bear the names of Wilbet,
Worbet and Ainbet. Etymologically these names seem to refer to the
well-disposed nature of a fay representing the Past; to the warring or
worrying troubles of the Present; and to the terrors (<i>Ain</i> =
<i>Agin</i>) of the Future. All over southern Germany, from Austria to
Alsace and Rhenish Hesse, the three fays are known under various names
besides Wilbet, Worbet, and Ainbet&mdash;for instance, as Mechtild,
Ottilia, and Gertraud; as Irmina, Adela, and Chlothildis, and so forth.
The fay in the middle of this trio is always a good fay, a white
fay&mdash;but blind. Her treasure (the very names of Ottilia and Adela
point to a treasure) is continually being taken from her by the third
fay, a dark and evil one, as well as by the first. This myth has been
interpreted as meaning that the Present, being blinded as to its own
existence, is continually being encroached upon, robbed as it were, by
the dark Future and the Past.
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256"> </a>
Of this particular trait there is no vestige in Shakspeare’s Weird
Sisters. They, like the Norns, “go hand in hand.” But there is another
point which claims attention Shakspeare’s Witches are bearded. (“You
should be women, and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are
so.” Act i, scene&nbsp;3.)</p>

<p>It need scarcely be brought to recollection that a commingling of the
female and male character occurs in the divine and semi-divine figures
of various mythological systems&mdash;including the Bearded Venus. Of
decisive importance is, however, the fact of a bearded Weird Sister
having apparently been believed in by our heathen German
forefathers.</p>

<p>Near Wessobrunn, in Upper Bavaria, where the semi-heathen fragment of
a cosmogonic lay, known as “Wessobrunn Prayer,” was discovered, there
has also been found, of late, a rudely-sculptured three-headed image. It
is looked upon as an ancient effigy of the German Norns. The Cloister of
the three Holy Bournes, or Fountains, which stands close by the place of
discovery, is supposed to have been set up on ground that had once
served for pagan worship. Probably the later monkish establishment of
the Three Holy Bournes had taken the place of a similarly named heathen
sanctuary where the three Sisters of Fate were once adored. Indeed, the
name of all the corresponding fays in yet current German folk-lore is
connected with holy wells. This quite fits in with the three Eddic
Bournes near the great Tree of Existence, at one of
which&mdash;apparently at the oldest, which is the very Source of
Being&mdash;the Norns live, “the maidens that over the Sea of Age travel
in deep foreknowledge,” and of whom it is said that:</p>

<p class = "verse">
They laid the lots, they ruled the life<br>
To the sons of men, their fate foretelling.
</p>

<p>Now, curiously enough, the central head of the slab found near
Wessobrunn, in the neighborhood of the Cloister of the Three Holy
Bournes, is <i>bearded</i>. This has puzzled our archæologists. Some of
them fancied that what appears to be a beard might after all be the hair
of one of the fays or Norns, tied round the chin. By the light of the
description of the Weird Sisters in Shakspeare’s <i>Macbeth</i> we,
however, see at once the true connection.</p>

<p>In every respect, therefore, his “Witches” are an echo from the
ancient Germanic creed&mdash;an echo, moreover, coming to us in the
oldest Teutonic verse-form; that is, in the staff-rime.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Elves.</span> The elves of later times seem a
sort of middle thing between the light and dark elves. They are fair and
lively, but also bad and mischievous. In some parts of Norway the
peasants describe them as diminutive naked boys with hats on. Traces of
their dance are sometimes to be seen on the wet grass, especially on the
banks of rivers. Their exhalation is injurious, and is called
<i>alfgust</i> or <i>elfblæst</i>, causing a swelling, which is easily
contracted by too nearly approaching places where they have spat, etc.
They have a predilection for certain spots, but particularly for large
trees, which on that account the owners do not venture to meddle with,
but look on them as something sacred, on which the weal or woe of the
place depends. Certain diseases among their cattle are attributed to the
elves, and are, therefore, called elf-fire or elf-shot. The dark elves
are often confounded with the dwarfs, with whom they, indeed, seem
identical, although they are distinguished in Odin’s Raven’s Song. The
Norwegians also make a distinction between dwarfs and elves, believing
the former to live solitary and in quiet, while the latter love music
and dancing. (Faye, p.&nbsp;48; quoted by Thorpe.)</p>

<p>The fairies of Scotland are precisely identical with the above. They
are described as a diminutive race of beings of a mixed or rather
dubious nature, capricious in their dispositions and mischievous in
their resentment. They inhabit the interior of green hills, chiefly
those of a conical form, in Gaelic termed <i>Sighan</i>, on which they
lead their dances by moonlight; impressing upon the surface the marks of
circles, which sometimes appear yellow and blasted,
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258"> </a>
sometimes of a deep green hue, and within which it is dangerous to
sleep, or to be found after sunset. Cattle which are suddenly seized
with the cramp, or some similar disorder, are said to be
<i>elf-shot</i>. (Scott’s Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border; quoted by
Thorpe.)</p>

<p>Of the Swedish elves, Arndt gives the following sketch: Of giants, of
dwarfs, of the alp, of dragons, that keep watch over treasures, they
have the usual stories; nor are the kindly elves forgotten. How often
has my postillion, when he observed a circular mark in the dewy grass,
exclaimed: See! there the elves have been dancing. These elf-dances play
a great part in the spinning-room. To those who at midnight happen to
enter one of these circles, the elves become visible, and may then play
all kinds of pranks with them; though in general they are little, merry,
harmless beings, both male and female. They often sit in small stones,
that are hollowed out in circular form, and which are called elf-querns
or mill-stones. Their voice is said to be soft like the air. If a loud
cry is heard in the forest, it is that of the Skogsrå (spirit of the
wood), which should be answered only by a <i>He!</i> when it can do no
harm. (Reise durch Sweden; quoted by Thorpe.)</p>

<p>The elf-shot was known in England in very remote times, as appears
from the Anglo-Saxon incantation, printed by Grimm in his Deutsche
Mythologie, and in the appendix to Kemble’s Saxons in England: Gif hit
wœre esa gescot oððe hit wœre ylfa gescot; that is, if it were an
asa-shot or an elf-shot. On this subject Grimm says: It is a very old
belief that dangerous arrows were shot by the elves from the air. The
thunder-bolt is also called elf-shot, and in Scotland
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259"> </a>
a hard, sharp, wedge-shaped stone is known by the name of elf-arrow,
elf-flint, elf-bolt, which, it is supposed, has been sent by the
spirits. (Quoted by Thorpe.)</p>


<h6>CHAPTER VII.</h6>

<p>Our ancestors divided the universe into nine worlds, and these again
into three groups:</p>

<p>1. Over the earth. Muspelheim, Ljosalfaheim and Asaheim.</p>

<p>2. On the earth. Jotunheim, Midgard and Vanheim.</p>

<p>3. Below the earth. Svartalfaheim, Niflheim and Niflhel.</p>

<p>The gods had twelve abodes:</p>

<p>1. <span class = "smallcaps">Thrudheim.</span> The abode of Thor. His
realm is Thrudvang, and his palace is Bilskirner.</p>

<p>2. <span class = "smallcaps">Ydaler.</span> Uller’s abode.</p>

<p>3. <span class = "smallcaps">Valaskjalf.</span> Odin’s hall.</p>

<p>4. <span class = "smallcaps">Sokvabek.</span> The abode of Saga.</p>

<p>5. <span class = "smallcaps">Gladsheim</span>, where there are twelve
seats for the gods, besides the throne occupied by Alfather.</p>

<p>6. <span class = "smallcaps">Thrymheim.</span> Skade’s abode.</p>

<p>7. <span class = "smallcaps">Breidablik.</span> Balder’s abode.</p>

<p>8. <span class = "smallcaps">Himminbjorg.</span> Heimdal’s abode.</p>

<p>9. <span class = "smallcaps">Folkvang.</span> Freyja’s abode.</p>

<p>10. <span class = "smallcaps">Glitner.</span> Forsete’s abode.</p>

<p>11. <span class = "smallcaps">Noatun.</span> Njord’s abode.</p>

<p>12. <span class = "smallcaps">Landvide.</span> Vidar’s abode.</p>

<p>According to the Lay of Grimner, the gods had twelve horses, but the
owner of each horse is not given:</p>

<p>(1) Sleipner (Odin’s), (2) Goldtop (Heimdal’s),
<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260"> </a>
(3) Glad, (4) Gyller, (5)&nbsp;Gler, (6)&nbsp;Skeidbrimer,
(7)&nbsp;Silvertop, (8)&nbsp;Siner, (9)&nbsp;Gisl, (10)&nbsp;Falhofner,
(11)&nbsp;Lightfoot, (12)&nbsp;Blodughofdi (Frey’s).</p>

<p>The owners of nine of them are not given, and, moreover, it is stated
that Thor had no horse, but always either went on foot or drove his
goats.</p>

<p>The favorite numbers are three, nine and twelve. Monotheism was
recognized in the unknown god, who is from everlasting to everlasting. A
number of trinities were established, and the nine worlds were
classified into three groups. The week had nine days, and originally
there were probably but nine gods, that is, before the vans were united
with the asas. The number nine occurs where Heimdal is said to have nine
mothers, Menglad is said to have nine maid-servants, Æger had nine
daughters, etc. When the vans were united with the asas, the number rose
to twelve:</p>

<p>(1) Odin, (2) Thor, (3) Tyr, (4) Balder, (5)&nbsp;Hoder,
(6)&nbsp;Heimdal, (7)&nbsp;Hermod, (8)&nbsp;Njord, (9)&nbsp;Frey,
(10)&nbsp;Uller, (11)&nbsp;Vidar, (12)&nbsp;Forsete.</p>

<p>If we add to this list Brage, Vale and Loke, we get fifteen; but the
Eddas everywhere declare that there are twelve gods, who were entitled
to divine worship.</p>

<p>The number of the goddesses is usually given as twenty-six.</p>

<h6>CHAPTER IX.</h6>

<p>Freyja’s ornament Brising. In the saga of Olaf Tryggvason, there is a
rather awkward story of the manner in which Freyja became possessed of
her ornament. Freyja, it is told, was a mistress of Odin. Not far from
the palace dwelt four dwarfs, whose names were Alfrig, Dvalin, Berling
and Grer; they were skillful smiths. Looking one day into their stony
dwelling, Freyja saw them at work on a beautiful golden necklace, or
collar, which she offered to buy, but which they refused to part with,
except on conditions quite incompatible with the fidelity she owed to
Odin, but to which she, nevertheless, was tempted to accede. Thus the
ornament became hers. By some means this transaction came to the
knowledge of Loke, who told it to Odin. Odin commanded him to get
possession of the ornament. This was no easy task, for no one could
enter Freyja’s bower without her consent. He went away whimpering, but
most were glad on seeing him in such tribulation. When he came to the
locked bower, he could nowhere find an entrance, and, it being cold
weather, he began to shiver. He then transformed himself into a fly and
tried every opening, but in vain; there was nowhere air enough to make
him to get through [Loke (fire) requires air]. At length he found a hole
in the roof, but not bigger than the prick of a needle. Through this he
<ins class = "correction" title = "variant spelling in original">slipt</ins>.
On his entrance he looked around to see if anyone were awake, but
all were buried in sleep. He peeped in at Freyja’s bed, and saw that she
had the ornament round her neck, but that the lock was on the side she
lay on. He then
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<a name = "page262"> </a>
transformed himself to a flea, placed himself on Freyja’s cheek, and
stung her so that she awoke, but only turned herself round and slept
again. He then laid aside his assumed form, cautiously took the
ornament, unlocked the bower, and took his prize to Odin. In the
morning, on waking, Freyja seeing the door open, without having been
forced, and that her ornament was gone, instantly understood the whole
affair. Having dressed herself, she repaired to Odin’s hall, and
upbraided him with having stolen her ornament, and insisted on its
restoration, which she finally obtained. (Quoted by Thorpe.)</p>

<p>Mention is also made of the Brósinga-men in the Beowulf (verse 2394).
Here it is represented as belonging to Hermanric, but the legend
concerning it has never been found.</p>


<h6>CHAPTER X.</h6>

<p>This myth about Frey and Gerd is the subject of one of the most
fascinating poems in the Elder Edda, the Journey of Skirner. It is, as
Auber Forestier, in Echoes from Mistland, says, the germ of the Niblung
story. Frey is Sigurd or Sigfrid, and Gerd is Brynhild. The myth is also
found in another poem of the Elder Edda, the Lay of Fjolsvin, in which
the god himself&mdash;there called Svipday (the hastener of the
day)&mdash;undertakes the journey to arouse from the winter sleep the
cold giant nature of the maiden Menglad (the sun-radiant daughter), who
is identical with Freyja (the goddess of spring, promise, or of love
between man and woman, and who can easily be compared with Gerd). Before
the bonds which enchain the maiden can in either case be broken, Bele
(the
<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263"> </a>
giant of spring storms, corresponding to the dragon Fafner in the
Niblung story,) must be conquered, and Wafurloge (the wall of bickering
flames that surrounded the castle) must be penetrated. The fanes
symbolize the funeral pyre, for whoever enters the nether world must
scorn the fear of death. (Auber Forestier’s Echoes from Mistland;
Introduction, xliii, xliv.) We also find this story repeated again and
again, in numberless variations, in Teutonic folk-lore; for instance, in
The Maiden on the Glass Mountain, where the glass mountain takes the
place of the bickering flame.</p>

<p>For a thorough analysis of Thor as a spring god, as the god who
dwells in the clouds, as the god of thunder and lightning, as the god of
agriculture, in short, as the god of culture, we can do no better than
to refer our readers to Der Mythus von Thor, nach Nordischen Quellen,
von Ludwig Uhland, Stuttgart, 1836; and to Handbuch der Deutschen

<h6>CHAPTER XIV.</h6>

<p>The death of Balder is justly regarded as the most beautiful myth in
Teutonic mythology. It is connected with the Lay of Vegtam in the Elder
Edda. Like so many other myths (Frey and Gerd, The Robbing of Idun,
etc.) the myth symbolizes originally the end of summer and return of
spring. Thus Balder dies every year and goes to Hel. But in the
following spring he returns to the asas, and gladdens all things living
and dead with his pure shining light. Gradually, however, the myth was
changed from a symbol of the departing and returning summer, and applied
to the departing and returning of the world year, and thus the death of
Balder prepares the way for Ragnarok and Regeneration. Balder goes to
Hel and does not return to this world. Thokk refuses to weep for him.
His return is promised after Ragnarok. The next spring does not bring
him back, but the rejuvenated earth. Thus the death of Balder becomes
the central thought in the drama of the fate of the gods and of the
world. It is inseparably connected with the punishment of Loke and the
twilight of the gods. The winter following the death of Balder is not an
ordinary winter, but the Fimbul-winter, which is followed by no summer,
but by the destruction of the world. The central idea in the Odinic
religion, the destruction and regeneration of the world, has taken this
beautiful sun-myth of Balder into its service. Balder is then no more
merely the pure holy light of heaven; he symbolizes at the same time the
purity and innocence of the gods; he is changed from a physical to an
ethical myth. He impersonated <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘al’">all</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265"> </a>
that was good and holy in the life of the gods; and so it came to pass
that when the golden age had ceased, when thirst for gold (Gulveig),
when sin and crime had come into the world, he was too good to live in
it. As in Genesis fratricide (Cain and Abel) followed upon the eating of
the forbidden fruit, and the loss of paradise; so, when the golden age
(paradise) had ended among the asas, Loke (the serpent) brought
fratricide (Hoder and Balder) among the gods; themselves and our
ancestors regarded fratricide as the lowest depth of moral depravity.
After the death of Balder</p>

<p>Upon the whole we may say that a sun-myth first represents the death
of the day at sunset, when the sky is radiant as if dyed in blood. In
the flushing morn light wins its victory again. Then this same myth
becomes transferred to the death and birth of summer. Once more it is
lifted into a higher sphere, while still holding on to its physical
interpretation, and is applied to the world year. Finally, it is clothed
with ethical attributes, becomes thoroughly anthropomorphized, and
typifies the good and the evil, the virtues and vices (light and
darkness), in the character and life of gods
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>

and of men. Thus we get four stages in the development of the myth.</p>


<h6>CHAPTER XV.</h6>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Ragnarok.</span> The word is found written
in two ways, Ragnarok and ragnarökr. Ragna is genitive plural, from the
word regin (god), and means of the gods. Rok means reason, ground,
origin, a wonder, sign, marvel. It is allied to the O.H.G. <i>rahha</i>
= sentence, judgment. Ragnarök would then mean <i>the history of the
gods</i>, and applied to the dissolution of the world, might be
translated <i>the last judgment</i>, <i>doomsday</i>, <i>weird of gods
and the world</i>. Rokr means <i>twilight</i>, and Ragnarokr, as the
Younger Edda has it, thus means <i>the twilight of the gods</i>, and the
latter is adopted by nearly all modern writers, although Gudbr.
Vigfusson declares that Ragnarok (doomsday) is no doubt the correct
form. And this is also to be said in favor of doomsday, that Ragnarok
does not involve only the <i>twilight</i>, but the whole <i>night</i> of
the gods and the world.</p>

<p>This chapter of <ins class = "correction" title =

valuable material for a correct understanding of the Nibelungen-Lied,
especially as to the origin of the Niblung hoard, and the true character
of Brynhild. The material given here, and in the Icelandic Volsunga
Saga, has been used by Wm. Morris in his Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall
of the Niblungs. In the Nibelungen-Lied, as transposed by Auber
Forestier, in Echoes from <ins class = "correction" title =

perfect gem of literature from the middle high German
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>

period, but its author had lost sight of the divine and mythical origin
of the material that he wove into his poem. It is only by combining the
German Nibelungen-Lied with the mythical materials found in Norseland
that our national Teutonic epic can be restored to us. Wagner has done
this for us in his famous drama; Jordan has done it in his Sigfrid’s
saga; Morris has done it in the work mentioned above; but will not Auber
Forestier gather up all the scattered fragments relating to Sigurd and
Brynhild, and weave them together into a prose narrative, that shall
delight the young and the old of this great land?</p>

<p>We are glad to welcome at this time a new book in the field of
Niblung literature. We refer to Geibel’s Brunhild, translated, with
introduction and notes, by Prof. G. Theo. Dippold, and recently
published in Boston.</p>

golden age in the life of the asas. Avarice is the root of crime, and
all other evils. Avarice is at the bottom of all the endless woes of the
Niblung story. The myth explaining why the sea is salt is told in a
variety of forms in different countries. In Germany there are several
folk-lore stories and traditions in regard to it. In Norway, where
folk-lore tales are so abundant, we find the myth about Menja and Fenja

<p>Long, long ago there were two brothers, the one was rich and the
other was poor. On Christmas eve the poor one had not a morsel of bread
or meat in his house, and so he went to his brother and asked him for
mercy’s sake to give him something for Christmas. It was not the first
time the brother had had to give him, and he was not very much pleased
to see him this time either.</p>

<p>“If you will do what I ask of you, I will give you a whole ham of
pork,” said&nbsp;he.</p>

<p>The poor man promised immediately, and was very thankful besides.</p>

<p>“There you have it, now go to hell,” said the rich one, and threw the
ham at&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>“What I have promised, I suppose, I must keep,” said the other. He
took the ham and started. He walked and walked the whole day, and at
twilight he came to a place where everything looked so bright and
splendid.</p>

<p>“This must be the place,” thought the man with the ham.</p>

<p>Out in the wood-shed stood an old man with a long white beard,
cutting wood for Christmas.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said the man with the ham.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir. Where are you going so late?” said
the&nbsp;man.</p>

<p>“I am on my way to hell, if I am on the right road,” said the
poor&nbsp;man.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have taken the right road; it is here,” said the old man.
“Now when you get in, they will all want to buy your ham, for pork is
rare food in
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>
<a name = "page269"> </a>
hell; but you must not sell it, unless you get the hand-mill that stands
back of the door for it. When you come out again I will show you how to
regulate it. You will find it useful in more than one respect.”</p>

<p>The man with the ham thanked the old man for this valuable
information, and rapped at the devil’s door.</p>

<p>When he came in it happened as the old man had said. All the devils,
both the large ones and the small ones, crowded around him like ants
around a worm, and the one bid higher than the other for
the&nbsp;ham.</p>

<p>“It is true my wife and I were to have it for our Christmas dinner,
but, seeing that you are so eager for it, I suppose I will have to let
you have it,” said the man. “But if I am to sell it, I want that
hand-mill that stands behind the door there for&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>The devil did not like to spare it, and kept dickering and bantering
with the man, but he insisted, and so the devil had to give him the
hand-mill. When the man came out in the yard he asked the old
wood-chopper how he should regulate the mill; and when he had learned
how to do it, he said “thank you,” and made for home as fast as he
could. But still he did not reach home before twelve o’clock in the
night Christmas&nbsp;eve.</p>

<p>“Why, where in the world have you been?” said the woman. “Here I have
been sitting hour after hour waiting and waiting, and I haven’t as much
as two sticks to put on the fire so as to cook the Christmas
porridge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could not come any sooner. I had several errands to do, and I
had a long way to go too. But
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270"> </a>
now I will show you,” said the man. He set the mill on the table, and
had it first grind light, then a table-cloth, then food and ale and all
sorts of good things for Christmas, and as he commanded the mill ground.
The woman expressed her great astonishment again and again, and wanted
to know where her husband had gotten the mill, but this he would not
tell.</p>

<p>“It makes no difference where I have gotten it; you see the mill is a
good one, and that the water does not freeze,” said the&nbsp;man.</p>

<p>Then he ground food and drink, and all good things, for the whole
Christmas week, and on the third day he invited his friends: he was
going to have a party. When the rich brother saw all the nice and good
things at the party, he became very wroth, for he could not bear to see
his brother have anything.</p>

<p>“Christmas eve he was so needy that he came to me and asked me for
mercy’s sake to give him a little food, and now he gives a feast as
though he were both count and king,” said he to the others.</p>

<p>“But where in hell have you gotten all your riches from?” said he to
his brother.</p>

<p>“Behind the door,” answered he who owned the mill. He did not care to
give any definite account, but later in the evening, when he began to
get a little tipsy, he could not help himself and brought out the
mill.</p>

<p>“There you see the one that has given me all the riches,” said he,
and then he let the mill grind both one thing and another. When the
brother saw this he was bound to have the mill, and after a long
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271"> </a>
bantering about it, he finally was to have it; but he was to pay three
hundred dollars for it, and his brother was to keep it until
harvest.</p>

<p>“When I keep it until then, I shall have ground food enough to last
many years,” thought&nbsp;he.</p>

<p>Of course the mill got no chance to grow rusty during the next six
months, and when harvest-time came, the rich brother got it; but the
other man had taken good care not to show him how to regulate it. It was
in the evening that the rich man brought the mill home, and in the
morning he bade his wife go and spread the hay after the
mowers,&mdash;he would get dinner ready, he said. Toward dinner he put
the mill on the table.</p>

<p>“Grind fish and gruel: Grind both well and fast!” said the man, and
the mill began to grind fish and gruel. It first filled all the dishes
and tubs full, and after that it covered the whole floor with fish and
gruel. The man kept puttering and tinkering, and tried to get the mill
to stop; but no matter how he turned it and fingered at it, the mill
kept on, and before long the gruel got so deep in the room that the man
was on the point of drowning. Then he opened the door to the
sitting-room, but before long that room was filled too, and the man had
all he could do to get hold of the door-latch down in this flood of
gruel. When he got the door open he did not remain long in the room. He
ran out as fast as he could, and there was a perfect flood of fish gruel
behind, deluging the yard and his fields.</p>

<p>The wife, who was in the meadow making hay, began to think that it
took a long time to get dinner ready.
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272"> </a>
“Even if husband does not call us, we will have to go anyway. I suppose
he does not know much about making gruel; I will have to go and help
him,” said the woman to the mowers.</p>

<p>They went homeward, but on coming up the hill they met the flood of
fish and gruel and bread, the one mixed up with the other, and the man
came running ahead of the flood.</p>

<p>“Would that each one of you had an hundred stomachs, but have a care
that you do not drown in the gruel flood,” cried the husband. He ran by
them as though the devil had been after him, and hastened down to his
brother. He begged him in the name of everything sacred to come and take
the mill away immediately.</p>

<p>“If it grinds another hour the whole settlement will perish in fish
and gruel,” said&nbsp;he.</p>

<p>But the brother would not take it unless he got three hundred
dollars, and this money had to be paid to&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>Now the poor brother had both money and the mill, and so it did not
take long before he got himself a farm, and a much nicer one than his
brother’s. With his mill he ground out so much gold that he covered his
house all over with sheets of gold. The house stood down by the
sea-shore, and it glistened far out upon the sea. All who sailed past
had to go ashore and visit the rich man in the golden house, and all
wanted to see the wonderful mill, for its fame spread far and wide, and
there was none who had not heard speak of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>After a long time there came a sea-captain who
<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273"> </a>
wished to see the mill. He asked whether it could grind salt.</p>

<p>“Yes, it can grind salt,” said he who owned the mill; and when the
captain heard this, he was bound to have it, let it cost what it will.
For if he had that, thought he, he would not have to sail far off over
dangerous waters after cargoes of salt. At first the man did not wish to
sell it, but the captain teased and begged and finally the man sold it,
and got many thousand dollars for it. When the captain had gotten the
mill on his back, he did not stay there long, for he was afraid the man
might reconsider the bargain and back out again. He had no time to ask
how to regulate it; he went to his ship as fast as he could, and when he
had gotten some distance out upon the sea, he got his mill&nbsp;out.</p>

<p>“Grind salt both fast and well,” said the captain. The mill began to
grind salt, and that with all its might. When the captain had gotten the
ship full he wanted to stop the mill; but no matter how he worked, and
no matter how he handled it, the mill kept grinding as fast as ever, and
the heap of salt kept growing larger and larger, and at last the ship
sank. The mill stands on the bottom of the sea grinding this very day,
and so it comes that the sea is salt.</p>

This etymology is, however, erroneous, for the word is derived from
<i>oln</i> or <i>öln</i>, and the true form of the word is

Asgard is supposed, by those who look for historical fact in
mythological tales, to be the present Assor; others, that it is Chasgar
in the Caucasian ridge, called by Strabo Aspargum the Asburg, or castle
of the asas. We still have in the Norse tongue the word Aas, meaning a
ridge of high land. The word asas is not derived from Asia, as Snorre
supposed. It is the O.H. Ger. <i>ans</i>; Anglo-Sax. <i>os</i> = a hero.
The word also means a pillar; and in this latter sense the gods are the
pillars of the universe. Connected with the word is undoubtedly Aas, a
mountain-ridge, as supporter of the skies; and this reminds us of
<i>Atlas</i>, as bearer of the world.</p>

This shows that the vans must have belonged to the mythological system
of some older race that, like the ancient Romans (Liber and Libera),
recognized the propriety of marriage between brothers and sisters, at
least among their gods. Such marriages were not allowed among our Odinic
ancestors. Hence we see that when Njord, Frey and Freyja were admitted
to Asgard, they entered into new marriage relations. Njord married
Skade, Frey married Gerd, and Freyja married Oder. Our ancestors were
never savages!</p>

Ancient Norse writers connect this event with Mithridates and Pompey the
Great. They tell how Odin was a heroic prince who, with his twelve peers
or apostles, dwelt in the Black Sea region. He became straightened for
room, and so led the asas out of Asia into eastern Europe. Then they go
on to tell how the Roman empire had arrived at its highest point of
power, and saw all the then known world&mdash;the orbis
terrarum&mdash;subject to its laws, when an unforeseen event raised up
enemies against it from the very heart of the forests of Scythia, and on
the banks of the Don river. The leader was Mithridates the Great,
against whom the Romans waged three wars, and the Romans looked upon him
as the most formidable enemy the empire had ever had to contend with.
Cicero delivered his famous oration, Pro lege Manilia, and succeeded in
getting Pompey appointed commander of the third war against Mithridates.
The latter, by flying, had drawn Pompey after him into the wilds of
Scythia. Here the king of Pontus sought refuge and new means of
vengeance. He hoped to arm against the ambition of Rome all his
neighboring nations whose liberties she threatened. He was successful at
first, but all those Scythian peoples, ill-united as allies, ill-armed
as soldiers, and still worse disciplined, were at length forced to yield
to the genius of the great general Pompey. And here traditions tell us
that Odin and the other asas were among the allies of Mithridates. Odin
had been one of the gallant defenders of Troy, and at the same time,
with Æneas and Anchises, he had taken flight out of the burning and
falling city. Now he was obliged to withdraw a second time by flight,
but this time it was not from the Greeks, but from the Romans, whom he
had offended by assisting Mithridates. He was now compelled to go and
seek, in lands unknown to his enemies, that safety which he could no
longer find in the Scythian forests. He then proceeded to the north of
Europe, and laid the foundations of the Teutonic nations. As fast as he
subdued the countries in the west and north of Europe he gave them to
one or another of his sons to govern. Thus it comes to pass that so many
sovereign families throughout Teutondom are said to be descended from
Odin. Hengist and Horsa, the chiefs of those Saxons who conquered
Britain in the fifth century, counted Odin in the number of their
ancestors. The traditions go on to tell how he conquered Denmark,
founded Odinse (Odinsve = Odin’s Sanctuary; comp. <i>ve</i> with the
German <i>Wei</i> in <i>Weinacht</i>), and gave the kingdom to his son
Skjold (shield); how he conquered Sweden, founded the Sigtuna temple,
and gave the country to his son Yngve; how finally Norway had to submit
to him, and be ruled by a third son of Odin, Saming.</p>

It has been seriously contended,&mdash;and it would form an important
element in an epic based on the historical Odin,&mdash;that a desire of
being revenged on the Romans was one of the ruling principles of Odin’s
whole conduct. Driven by those foes of universal liberty from his former
home in the east, his resentment was the more violent, since the Teutons
thought it a sacred duty to revenge all injuries, especially those
offered to kinsmen or country. Odin had no other view in traversing so
many distant lands, and in establishing with so much zeal his doctrines
of valor, than to arouse all Teutonic nations, and unite them against so
formidable and odious a race as the Romans. And we, who live in the
light of the nineteenth century, and with the records before us, can
read the history of the convulsions of Europe during the decline of the
Roman empire; we can understand how that leaven, which Odin left in the
bosoms of the believers in the asa-faith, first fermented a long time in
secret; but we can also see how in the fullness of time, the signal
given, the descendants of Odin fell like a swarm of locusts upon this
unhappy empire, and, after giving it many terrible shocks, eventually
overturned it, thus completely avenging the insult offered so many
centuries before by Pompey to their founder Odin. We can understand how
it became possible for “those vast multitudes, which the populous north
poured from her frozen loins, to pass the Rhine and the Danube, and come
like a deluge on the south, and spread beneath Gibraltar and the Libyan
sands;” how it were possible, we say, for them so largely to remodel and
invigorate a considerable part of Europe, nay, how they could succeed in
overrunning and overturning “the rich but rotten, the mighty but
marrowless, the disciplined but diseased, Roman empire; that gigantic
and heartless and merciless usurpation of soulless materialism and
abject superstition of universal despotism, of systemized and relentless
plunder, and of depravity deep as hell.” In connection with this subject
we would refer our readers to Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, pp. 79-83,
where substantially the same account is given; to Norse Mythology, pp.
232-236; to George Stephen’s Runic Monuments, Vol. I; and to Charles
Kingsley’s The Roman and the Teuton.</p>

Sigtun. <i>Sige</i>, Ger. Sieg, (comp. Sigfrid,) means victory, and is

Berserk. The etymology of this word has been much contested. Some, upon
the authority of Snorre in the above quoted passage, derive it from berr
(<i>bare</i>) and serkr (comp. <i>sark</i>, Scotch for shirt); but this
etymology is inadmissible, because serkr is a substantive, not an
adjective. Others derive it from berr (Germ. <i>Bär</i> = <i>ursus</i>),
which is greatly to be preferred, for in olden ages athletes and
champions used to wear hides of bears, wolves and reindeer
(as&nbsp;skins of lions in the south), hence the names Bjalfe,
Bjarnhedinn, Ulfhedinn (hedinn, <i>pellis</i>),&mdash;“pellibus aut
parvis rhenonum tegimentis utuntur.” Cæsar, Bell. Gall. VI, 22. Even the
old poets understood the name so, as may be seen in the poem of
Hornklofi (beginning of the 10th century), a dialogue between a valkyrie
and a raven, where the valkyrie says at berserkja reiðu vil ek <ins
class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘pik’">þik</ins> spyrja, to which the raven replies,
Ulfhednar heita, <i>they are called wolf coats</i>. In battle the
berserks were subject to fits of frenzy, called <i>berserksgangr</i>
(<i>furor bersercicus</i>), when they howled like wild beasts, foamed at
the mouth, and gnawed the iron rim of their shields. During these fits
they were, according to a popular belief, proof against steel and fire,
and made great havoc in the ranks of the enemy. But when the fever
abated they were weak and tame. Vigfusson Cleasby’s Icelandic-English
Dictionary, <i>sub voce</i>.</p>

The old Norse word is órlög, which is plural, (from ör = Ger. <i>ur</i>,
and lög, <i>laws</i>,) and means the primal law, fate, weird, doom; the
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "Greek: moira">μοῖρα</span>. The
idea of predestination was a salient feature in the Odinic religion. The
word örlog, O.H.G. <i>urlac</i>, M.H.G. <i>urlone</i>, Dutch
<i>orlog</i>, had special reference to a man’s fate in war. Hence
Orlogschiffe in German means a naval fleet. The Danish orlog means
warfare at&nbsp;sea.</p>

Here ends Snorre’s account of the asas in Heimskringla. The reader will,
of course, compare the account here given of Odin, Njord, Frey, Freyja,
etc., with the purely mythological description of them in the Younger
Edda, and with that in Norse Mythology. Upon the whole, Snorre has
striven to accommodate his sketch to the Eddas, while he has had to
clothe mythical beings with the characteristics of human kings. Like
Saxo-Grammaticus, Snorre has striven to show that the deities, which we
now recognize as personified forces and phenomena of nature, were
extraordinary and enterprising persons, who formerly ruled in the North,
and inaugurated the customs, government and religion of Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Germany, England, and the other Teutonic lands.</p>
